The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and  TTPs identified through FBI and ASD’S ACSC investigations. (New, November 20, 2024) The reporting agencies are aware of multiple ransomware groups, like  BianLian, that seek to misattribute location and nationality by choosing foreign-language names, almost  May 16, 2023 Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from BianLian data  extortion:    Strictly limit the use of RDP and  other remote desktop services. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data  extortion cybercriminal group, likely based in Russia, with multiple Russia-based affiliates. BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after  exfiltrating the data; however, they shifted primarily to exfiltration-based extortion around January 2023  and shifted to exclusively exfiltration-based extortion around January 2024. FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small- and medium-sized  organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the  likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware and data extortion incidents. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group. BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in  which they exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files for leverage and encrypted  victims’ systems. In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift primarily to exfiltration-based extortion with victims’  systems left intact, and ASD’S ACSC observed BianLian shift exclusively to exfiltration-based extortion. Exfiltration and Impact  BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See Appendix: Windows  PowerShell and Command Shell Activity) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023,  BianLian actors encrypted files [T1486] after exfiltration for double extortion.

In addition, FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to  limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:    Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data  and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage  device, or the cloud). We got proofs that  your data was kept with a number of data security violations of data breach  laws. If this leak will take  place they will have to monitor their credit history and identity theft for next  3 years. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to  help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories  and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost  resources. (See Figure 1 for a legacy  ransomware note). Figure 1: BianLian Sample Legacy Ransom Note (Look at this instruction.txt)  (New, November 20, 2024) Newer ransomware notes state BianLian group has exfiltrated data and  threaten to leak the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool  that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network.

Regardless of whether you  or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report  ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office or CISA at cisa.gov/report.

Iranian Cyber Actors Targeting Personal Accounts to Support Operations,2024-09-27,3,"{'phishing': 6, 'threats_of_violence': 1}","The authoring agencies recommend the following mitigation actions:  Social Engineering/Spoofing  •  Be suspicious of unsolicited contact from any individual you do not know personally or contact  from people you may know but are claiming to be using new accounts or phone numbers. Enterprise Mitigation  •  Implement a user training program with phishing exercises to raise and maintain awareness  among users about risks of visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spear-phishing emails. •  Enable anti-phishing and anti-spoofing security features that block malicious email. •  Configure Sender Policy Framework, DomainKeys Identified Mail, and Domain-based  Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance to prevent spoofing and validate email. •  When available, use single sign on with either Passkeys, alternate Fast Identity Online (FIDO)  authenticators, or Single Sign On backed by a phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 1 The IRGC is an Iranian Government agency tasked with defending the Iranian Regime from perceived internal and external threats."

Product ID: JCSA-20240918-001 September 18, 2024  TLP:CLEAR     People’s Republic of China-Linked Actors  Compromise Routers and IoT Devices for  Botnet Operations  Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), and National Security  Agency (NSA) assess that People’s Republic of China (PRC)-linked cyber actors have compromised  thousands of Internet-connected devices, including small office/home office (SOHO) routers, firewalls,  network-attached storage (NAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the goal of creating a network of  compromised nodes (a “botnet”) positioned for malicious activity. The actors may then use the botnet as a  proxy to conceal their identities while deploying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or  compromising targeted U.S. Integrity Technology Group (Integrity Tech), a PRC-based company, has controlled and managed a botnet  active since mid-2021. The botnet has regularly maintained between tens to hundreds of thousands of  compromised devices. As of June 2024, the botnet consisted of over 260,000 devices. Victim devices  which are part of the botnet have been observed in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,  Southeast Asia and Australia. While devices aged beyond their end-of-life dates are known to be more vulnerable to intrusion, many of the  compromised devices in the Integrity Tech-controlled botnet are likely still supported by their respective vendors. FBI, CNMF, NSA, and allied partners are releasing this Joint Cyber Security Advisory to highlight the threat  posed by these actors and their botnet activity and to encourage exposed device vendors, owners, and  operators to update and secure their devices from being compromised and joining the botnet. Network  defenders are advised to follow the guidance in the mitigations section to protect against the PRC-linked  cyber actors’ botnet activity. Cyber security companies can also leverage the information in this advisory to  assist with identifying malicious activity and reducing the number of devices present in botnets worldwide. Integrity Tech has used  China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses to control and manage the botnet described in this  advisory. In addition to managing the botnet, these same China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses were  used to access other operational infrastructure employed in computer intrusion activities against U.S. Botnet Command and Control  As with similar botnets, this botnet infrastructure is comprised of a network of devices, known as “bots,”  which are infected with a type of malware that provides threat actors with unauthorized remote access. A  functioning botnet can be used for a variety of purposes, including malware delivery, distributed denial of  service (DDoS) attacks, or routing nefarious Internet traffic. The botnet uses the Mirai family of malware, designed to hijack IoT devices such as webcams, DVRs, IP  cameras, and routers running Linux-based operating systems. The Mirai source code was posted publicly  on the Internet in 2016, resulting in other hackers creating their own botnets based on the malware. Since  that time, various Mirai botnets have been used to conduct DDoS and other malicious activities against  victim entities within the U.S. The investigated botnet’s customized Mirai malware is a component of a system that automates the  compromise of a variety of devices. To recruit a new “bot,” the botnet system first compromises an  Internet-connected device using one of a variety of known vulnerability exploits (see Appendix B: Observed  CVEs). A variety of subdomains of “w8510.com” were linked to the botnet’s C2 servers. Page 3 of 18  |  Product ID: JCSA-20240918-001    TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Botnet Management  A tier of upstream management servers using TCP port 34125 manage the botnet’s C2 servers. These  management servers host a MySQL database which stored information used for the control of the botnet. The management servers hosted an application known as “Sparrow,” which allows users to interact with  the botnet. The code for the Sparrow application, stored within a Git repository, defines functions that allow registered  users to manage and control the botnet and C2 servers, sending tasks to victim devices including DDoS  and exploitation commands to grow the botnet. A subcomponent called “vulnerability arsenal” also allows users to  exploit traditional computer networks through the victim devices in the botnet. Compromised Device Distribution  The following tables approximate the count of devices compromised by the botnet system as of June 2024,  by location and by processor architecture. There were at least 50 different Linux operating system versions  found among botnet nodes. The following guidance applies both to  preventing IoT devices from becoming part of a botnet, as well as to defending networks from botnets  already in operation. Since DDoS attacks originating from botnets may at first  appear similar to normal traffic, it is critical for organizations to define, monitor and prepare for  abnormal traffic volumes.

Unit 29155 cyber actors’ use of WhisperGate involved the deployment of the malware files, stage1.exe  and stage2.exe. The actors  used multiple Discord accounts to store malware files, including what appears to be development versions  or iterations of the binaries. Discord is commonly leveraged by threat actors as an endpoint for malware  distribution and control; in this case, it was used to obtain the next step of the infection chain by directly  sharing files through its platform. All clusters used Discord as a staging environment for malware  deployment. These groupings are based on analysis of threat actor IP addresses and the nature of the  malware that existed within the accounts.

Instead, the note provides victims with a client ID and instructs  them to contact the ransomware group via a unique .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). The  ransom note typically gives victims between three and 90 days to pay the ransom (depending on the  affiliate) before the ransomware group publishes their data on the RansomHub Tor data leak site. The authoring organizations encourage network defenders to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this cybersecurity advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware  incidents. Defense Evasion  Cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates renaming the ransomware executable with innocuous  file names, such as Windows.exe, left on the user’s desktop (C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop) or  downloads (C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads) [T1036].

Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations,2024-08-28,3,"{'ransomware': 18, 'threats_of_violence': 1, 'malware': 2}","TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA24-241A August 28, 2024  TLP:CLEAR Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling  Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations  Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to  warn network defenders that, as of August 2024, a group of Iran-based cyber actors continues to exploit  U.S. The FBI assesses a significant  percentage of these threat actors’ operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop  network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further  assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and—separate  from the ransomware activity—conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such  as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan). A significant percentage of the group’s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of  obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to  enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have  collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[3], Ransomhouse[4], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat)  (#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat). The Iranian cyber actors’ involvement in these ransomware attacks  goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and  strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based  location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously  referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and  organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group’s  ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. However, the group’s ransomware activities are likely not  sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency  movement associated with their malicious activity. Exfiltration and Impact  After infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape,  Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by  providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort  victims [T1657].

As demonstrated in the joint-sealed publication Identifying and  Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are employing LOTL  techniques to evade detection. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of log sources and their threats, and  their priority may differ between organisations. Logging priorities for enterprise networks Enterprise networks face a large variety of cyber threats. Their integration has introduced new cyber threats to OT environments. Detection strategy for relevant threats Detecting living off the land techniques ASD’s ACSC and co-authors recommend that organisations consider implementing user and entity  behavioural analytics capabilities to enable automated detection of behavioural anomalies on  networks, devices, or accounts. To detect threats on endpoints such as user devices, organisations should consider implementing  an endpoint detection and response solution. Their campaign has been enabled by privately-owned SOHO routers,  infected with the ‘KV Botnet’ malware. Best practices for event logging and threat detection 4  Introduction The increased prevalence of malicious actors employing LOTL techniques, such as LOTL binaries  (LOLBins) and fileless malware, highlights the importance of implementing and maintaining an  effective event logging solution. When assessing the risks to a system,  consider that in some cases, it can take up to 18 months to discover a cyber security incident and some  malware can dwell on the network from 70 to 200 days before causing overt harm.3 Log retention  periods should also be compliant with any regulatory requirements and cyber security frameworks  that may apply in an organisation’s jurisdiction. These include malware, malicious insiders,  and exploitation of unpatched applications and services. For example,  malicious actors can access OT networks through IT networks by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities,  delivering malware, or conducting denial-of-service campaigns to impact critical services. While Volt Typhoon uses LOTL techniques to make detection more difficult, the behaviours that the  malware exhibits would be considered abnormal compared to business-as-usual activity and could be  used to create detection use cases."

(Updated August 7, 2024) BlackSuit conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to encryption and then  publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. (Updated August 7, 2024) Ransom demands have typically ranged from approximately $1 million to $10  million USD, with payment demanded in Bitcoin. BlackSuit actors have demanded over $500 million USD  in total and the largest individual ransom demand was $60 million. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption percentage  for larger files, which helps evade detection, and also significantly improves ransomware speed.[1] In  addition to encrypting files, BlackSuit actors also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten  to publicly release the exfiltrated data if the victim does not pay the ransom.

Actions for Organizations to Take Today to  Mitigate Cyber Threats Related to  BlackSuit Ransomware Activity         FBI | CISA Page 2 of 31  |  Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR and TTPs identified through FBI threat response activities and third-party reporting as recently as of July  2024. BlackSuit ransomware is the evolution of the ransomware previously identified as Royal  ransomware, which was used from approximately September 2022 through June 2023. BlackSuit shares  numerous coding similarities with Royal ransomware and has exhibited improved capabilities. After gaining access to victims’ networks, BlackSuit  actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the  ransomware and encrypting the systems. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Ransomware operators often use  open source projects to aid their intrusion activities. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. BlackSuit actors have been  observed using legitimate software and open source tools during ransomware operations. Indicators of Compromise (IOC)  See Table 1 through Table 5 for Royal ransomware IOCs obtained by FBI during threat response activities  as of January 2023. (New November 13, 2023) See Table 6 and Table 7 for Royal and BlackSuit Ransomware IOCs as of June  2023. (New August 7, 2024) See Table 9 through Table 15 for BlackSuit ransomware IOCs obtained by FBI during  threat response activities as of July 2024 and Figure 1 for a sample ransom note.

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 3.A]. To aid in detecting the ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a  network. Resources    Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Note: The joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices  as well as a ransomware response checklist.   No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you  to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), a local FBI Field  Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov  or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). Version History  January 31, 2023: Initial Release (Royal Ransomware)  November 13, 2023: First Update (Royal Ransomware)  August 7, 2024: Updated title from “Royal Ransomware” to “BlackSuit Ransomware”; updates noted  throughout. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. (New August 7, 2024) BlackSuit actors use SystemBC and Gootloader malware to load additional tools and  maintain persistence. FBI | CISA Page 4 of 31  |  Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Exfiltration  BlackSuit actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration testing  tools, such as Cobalt Strike, and malware tools/derivatives, such as Ursnif/Gozi, for data aggregation and  exfiltration."
Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem,2024-08-06,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 1}","•  If the software manufacturer manages authentication, does it enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) or other  phishing-resistant forms of authentication like passkeys by default, and at no cost? Any form of MFA has been shown to  significantly reduce the success of such activity, with more secure forms of MFA, like phishing-resistant MFA, offering  even more protection against targeted activity. Ensuring that  the products they use and procure are secure by design is essential for organizations to be resilient against ransomware  and other forms of malicious cyber activity."

Commodity Malware and Dual-Use Applications  Commodity malware is malicious software widely available for purchase or use and is leveraged by  numerous different threat actors. The use  of publicly available malware and dual-use applications enables the actors to conceal and obfuscate their  identities and leads to attribution problems. The authoring agencies are reliant on the use of custom  malware and loaders, along with overlapping C2 nodes to attribute commodity malware to the actors. The  actors have at times achieved great success obfuscating their identities by leveraging open source  malware or dual-use applications. The typos also illustrate a poor  grasp of the English language, including common errors such as “Microsoft Cooperation” (rather than  “Microsoft Corporation”) found across numerous RGB 3rd Bureau malware samples. The actors disguise their malware within HTTP packets to appear as benign  network traffic. Collection and Exfiltration   Malware previously used by the actors permitted placement and access to search through files that could  be of interest, including scanning computer files for keywords related to defense and military sectors in  English and Korean. The following include observed MD5 hashes:  ▪  88a7c84ac7f7ed310b5ee791ec8bd6c5  ▪  6ab4eb4c23c9e419fbba85884ea141f4  ▪  97ce00c7ef1f7d98b48291d73d900181  ▪  079b4588eaa99a1e802adf5e0b26d8aa     Page

2024 U.S. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat,2024-06-28,2,"{'extortion': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 14}","•  Adversaries may attempt to blackmail or coerce an insider to leverage the insider’s access, collect insights on  election security efforts and vulnerabilities, or direct the insider to perform malicious activity. Prior to initiating  contact, the foreign adversaries likely would collect information on the target to uncover anything they could use  for blackmail or coercion. For years, federal, state, local, and private sector partners nationwide have  worked closely together to support state and local officials in safeguarding election infrastructure from cyber, physical,  and insider threats. Over the past several years, the election infrastructure community  has experienced multiple instances of election system access control compromises conducted by insider threats. While  there is no evidence that malicious actors impacted election outcomes, it is important that election stakeholders at all  levels are aware of the risks posed by insider threats and the steps that they can take to identify and mitigate these  threats. This document outlines several recent examples of election security-related insider threats, discusses potential scenarios  that could arise during the 2024 election cycle, and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the risk posed by  insider threats.1  Insider Threats to Elections  In the United States, elections are administered at the state and local levels of government, which has resulted in a  diverse landscape of election systems and technologies across the country. Insider threats could manifest as current or former employees, temporary workers, volunteers,  contractors, or any other individuals with privileged access to election systems and information. Recent Examples of Election Infrastructure-related Insider Threats  •  A temporary election worker inserted an unauthorized personal flash drive into an electronic poll book containing  voter registration data, including confidential information barred from release under state law. Potential for Foreign Adversary Exploitation of Insider Threats  To date, the examples of insider threat activity related to the elections process have been domestic in nature, both in  terms of the actor and the motivations. Potential Indicators of Insider Threat Activity  Individuals at risk of becoming insider threats often exhibit warning signs, or indicators.2 The following list is not all  inclusive, but contains potential flags that election officials should be alert to and seek further review by authorities:  •  Attempting to alter or destroy ballots, mail-in ballot envelopes, administrative documentation, or allowing others  to access these materials without prior approval. Provided they  receive the necessary oversight to ensure they are being applied appropriately, preventative measures against insider  threats also contribute to detecting threats by establishing transparent, auditable election systems and processes and  then identifying outliers or anomalies for investigation. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat  cisa.gov  central@cisa.dhs.gov  @CISAgov @CISACyber  @cisagov  •  Physical and Digital Access Control systems can detect and prevent insider threats. •  Continuous Monitoring is a key practice for detecting anomalous behavior, to include potential insider threats. This will assist stakeholders as they keep a  record of organizational actions related to an insider threat incident, promote accountability of necessary steps to protect  assets, and to identify vulnerabilities in the effort of mitigating future insider threats. 5 Concern Type Examples include: Verbal/Written Threats; Terrorism/Violent Extremism; Personal  Conduct; Financial Considerations; Substance Abuse; Behavioral Considerations; Criminal  Conduct; Mishandling Protected Information; Misuse of Information Technology; Cyber  Crime; Espionage; Financial/Intellectual Property Theft; Workplace Violence Please share details about the individual(s) associated with the suspicious activity in the following section: 6 Name (or Description if Unknown) Example: John Doe 7 Job Title Example: Analyst, Sales Rep, Software Engineer 8 Role or Job Type Example: Employee, Contractor, Consultant, Vendor, etc. What technology  identified the breach (if applicable)?” 2 Concern Type Examples include: Verbal/Written Threats; Terrorism/Violent Extremism; Personal Conduct; Financial Considerations;  Substance Abuse; Behavioral Considerations; Criminal Conduct; Mishandling Protected Information; Misuse of Information  Technology; Espionage; Financial/Intellectual Property Theft; Other 3 Has the appropriate security professional been notified?"

Set up phishing- resistant MFA makes it more difficult for actors to compromise user accounts, and often  make legitimate user sign-ins simpler at the same time. See CISA’s Phishing-Resistant  Multifactor Authentication guide for additional information. 9) Implement basic cybersecurity training to cover concepts such as account phishing, email  and web browsing security, and password security [CPG 2.I]. State-sponsored actors use this information to:  •  Scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives;  •  Identify targets, including individuals for potential phishing campaigns; and  •  Gather device and network information (such as IP addresses and operating systems). Threat actors also use phishing, a form of social engineering, to steal login credentials for initial  network access. State-sponsored actors invest substantial time and resources crafting identities for phishing  attempts, leading to meticulously tailored attempts (this is specifically known as “spearphishing”). Phishing for Information  T1598  Malicious actors send phishing messages to elicit  sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) that  can be used for future operations. Description of Known Initial Access Techniques: Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors use  credentials obtained via their phishing attempts (see the Reconnaissance section) to gain access to  networks. APT actors also leverage malware-based phishing to obtain initial access to targets. In malware- based phishing attacks, malicious actors pose as trustworthy sources to lure a victim into interacting  with a malicious hyperlink or opening an email attachment to execute malware on host systems. Note: Phishing is  often made easier by the prevalence of well-known weaknesses in software that actors exploit to  deliver their malware payloads. Examples: APT groups associated with Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia integrate spearphishing  emails into broader campaigns aimed at high-risk communities. Velvet Chollima’s spearphishing operations showcase a nuanced and targeted  cyber espionage strategy, employing social engineering and malicious  payloads to infiltrate and monitor the communications of high-value targets. 16 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Mustang Panda:  The group’s preferred initial intrusion vector is spearphishing emails, primarily  to deploy remote access Trojans.

Organizations with low defense capacity are ill-prepared for and vulnerable to common cyber  threats, such as social engineering attempts. Low defense capacity is exacerbated, in most cases, by products and services designed in a manner  that places the burden of reducing cyber threats on the customer or end user. This joint guide, developed as part of CISA’s High-Risk Community Protection (HRCP) initiative* and  NCSC-UK’s Defending Democracy campaign†, provides mitigation measures for civil society  organizations to reduce their risk based on common cyber threats. The authoring agencies also encourage software manufacturers to take  responsibility for their customers’ security outcomes by applying the mitigations in this advisory and  designing products that prevent the most common classes of attack by malicious actors.‡      * Established in 2023, CISA’s HRCP initiative serves as the enduring home for the agency’s work to identify and partner  with high-risk communities to understand the threats they face, identify the resources which can bolster their defense, and  close gaps in support. Through the NCSC’s Defending Democracy work, the NCSC is seeking to partner with high-risk public and  elected officials to advance understanding of the sophisticated threats targeting individuals across personal and enterprise  devices. 5 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Cyber Threats to Civil Society  The lack of reporting in threat telemetry and intelligence feeds, coupled with HRCs’ limited  accessibility to enterprise-level solutions, hinders commercial and government organizations’  accurate measurement of threats posed to HRCs. Notably and  frequently non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, human rights activists, and  journalists are targeted by state-sponsored actors:  •  According to Microsoft, in 2023 NGOs and think tanks were the second highest targets of  state-sponsored actors (following the Information Technology Sector).1  •  As of November 2023, CrowdStrike reporting revealed that five state-sponsored groups are  known to target think tanks,2 eleven groups represent potential threats to NGOs,3 two groups  target dissidents,4 and one group is known to target nonprofit organizations (NPOs).5  •  Cloudflare has observed that malicious cyber activity against civil society organizations is  “generally increasing.”6 In Quarter 2 of 2023, NPOs were targeted more than any other  industry when looking at malicious traffic to NPO websites as a proportion of total traffic.7 In  Quarter 3 of 2023, NPO and independent media organizations placed second behind the  metals and mining industry, with 17.14% of all traffic to NPOs representing distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.8 Similarly, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) found that targeted individuals within civil society were the second most-targeted  sector globally between July 2022 and June 2023.9  State-sponsored actors target civil society organizations and their staff as part of their toolkit to  undermine democratic values. These cybersecurity  controls provide a minimum set of practices and  protections that are informed by the most common  and impactful threats and behaviors. • Informed by threats observed by CISA  and its government and industry  partners. To enhance personal and organizational  cybersecurity, comprehension of the specific threats and behaviors relevant to your industry  or self is essential. Establish a reference list that outlines potential threats, considering the  unique risk landscape associated with your work, interests, and organizations. This can  include industry-specific cyber threats, regulatory considerations, and historical attack  patterns. o Use trusted app stores to avoid potential threats from malicious third-party applications. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, APTs from Iran (Charming Kitten), China (Phantom Panda, Aquatic Panda), and North Korea (Velvet  Chollima, Ricochet Chollima) represented potential threats to think tanks. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, APTs from Iran (Static Kitten, Haywire Kitten, Charming Kitten), China (Cascade Panda, Overcast  Panda, Aquatic Panda, Emissary Panda), the Russian Federation (Fancy Bear, Gossamer Bear), and North Korea (Velvet  Chollima, Ricochet Chollima) represented potential threats to NGOs. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, a North Korean APT (Ricochet Chollima) and Iranian APT (Charming Kitten) represented potential  threats to dissidents. After research, state-sponsored actors will often  gain access to organization networks or personal devices via (a) social engineering that lures victims  to divulge account credentials or download malware or (b) having users download seemingly  legitimate apps that house malicious software. Without encryption, threat actors can  exploit unencrypted or unauthenticated channels to inject malware into user devices, posing  significant risks to privacy and security. Malicious cyber actors often exploit well- known weaknesses in software to deliver their payloads via malware. •  Implement attention grabbing alerts so customers are aware of unsafe configurations,  suspicious behavior, and when they are downloading malware. The  malware deployed enables data theft, surveillance, or advanced cyber intrusions. Notably, these  links frequently conceal malware that provides Velvet Chollima with  unauthorized access to the victim’s personal computer and facilitating the  surveillance of the victim’s communications. The messages result in  code execution or malware download on victim  systems. The links lead to the download of  malware to the victim system generally via social  engineering encouraging recipients to actively click  or copy the URL (this requires the related technique  User Execution [T1204]). They also use Trojanized apps. Examples: The examples below identify how state-sponsored actors use Trojanized applications and  Spyware in their campaigns. Analysis by TrendMicro revealed that upon downloading these apps, the  user's device became infected with malware. Additionally,  the malware granted unauthorized access to the device's camera,  microphone, and screenshot capabilities, exemplifying the group's advanced  and intrusive surveillance techniques.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint CSA to provide  information on Black Basta, a ransomware variant whose actors have encrypted and stolen data from at  least 12 out of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector. Black  Basta is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April 2022. Black  Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America,  Actions for critical infrastructure  organizations to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:    Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware  as soon as they are released. Instead, the  notes provide victims with a unique code and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a  .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Typically, the ransom notes give victims between 10 and  12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site,  Basta News. The authoring organizations urge HPH Sector and all critical infrastructure organizations to apply the  recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from Black  Basta and other ransomware attacks. Victims of ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI  field office or CISA (see the Reporting section for contact information). For historic reference, see AA24-131A #StopRansomware: Black Basta (Initial Version).   Apply mitigations from the joint #StopRansomware Guide.

North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts,2024-05-02,2,"{'phishing': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 2}","Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR Product ID: JCSA-20240502-001  May 2, 2024                              North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC  Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. The North Korean cyber actors have conducted  spearphishing campaigns posing as legitimate journalists, academics, or other experts in East Asian  affairs with credible links to North Korean policy circles. North Korea leverages these spearphishing  campaigns to collect intelligence on geopolitical events, adversary foreign policy strategies, and any  information affecting North Korean interests by gaining illicit access to targets’ private documents,  research, and communications. This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes indicators of North  Korean social engineering (page 4) for potential victims receiving spearphishing emails as well as  mitigation measures (page 9) for organizations who could be victims of North Korean impersonation. Successful compromises further enable  Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spearphishing emails, which can then be  leveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets. The authoring agencies seek to bring awareness of these campaigns to degrade or minimize the  effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. When an organization securely configures a DMARC policy, it helps ensure  malicious actors, like Kimsuky, are unable to spoof the organization’s legitimate email domain when  sending spearphishing messages to a target.

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network.

Product ID: AA24-060A February 29, 2024 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: Phobos Ransomware  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of  an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail various  ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently  and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise  (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all  #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about  other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint CSA, to disseminate known TTPs and IOCs associated with the Phobos ransomware variants  observed as recently as February 2024, according to open source reporting. Phobos is structured as  a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. Since May 2019, Phobos ransomware incidents impacting  state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments have been regularly reported to the MS-ISAC. dollars.[1],[2]  The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Phobos ransomware and other  ransomware incidents. For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:  •  AA24-060A (STIX XML, 148KB)  •  AA24-060A (STIX JSON, 120KB)  Actions to take today to mitigate  Phobos ransomware activity:  •  Secure RDP ports to prevent threat  actors from abusing and leveraging  RDP tools. Overview  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware is likely connected to numerous variants  (including Elking, Eight, Devos, Backmydata, and Faust ransomware) due to similar TTPs observed in  Phobos intrusions. Phobos ransomware operates in conjunction with various open source tools such  as Smokeloader, Cobalt Strike, and Bloodhound. Additional Phobos Defense Evasion Capabilities  Phobos ransomware actors have been observed bypassing organizational network defense protocols  by modifying system firewall configurations using commands like netsh firewall set opmode  mode=disable [T1562.004]. Persistence and Privilege Escalation  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware uses commands such as Exec.exe or the  bcdedit[.]exe control mechanism. Furthermore, Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate connected storage devices [T1082], running  processes [T1057], and encrypt user files [T1083]. Each Phobos ransomware executable has unique build identifiers (IDs), affiliate IDs, as well as a  unique ransom note which is embedded in the executable. After the ransom note has populated on  infected workstations, Phobos ransomware continues to search for and encrypt additional files.

The FBI,  CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend that software  manufacturers incorporate secure by design and  default principles and tactics into their software  development practices limiting the impact of  ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the  secure posture for their customers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including  lateral movement, on a network.

CISA and NIST  based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,  techniques, and procedures. Threat actors leveraging Phobos have notably  deployed remote access tools to establish a remote connection within the compromised network  [T1219].[7]  Alternatively, threat actors send spoofed email attachments [T1566.001] that are embedded with  hidden payloads [T1204.002] such as SmokeLoader, a backdoor trojan that is often used in  conjunction with Phobos. After SmokeLoader’s hidden payload is downloaded onto the victim’s  system, threat actors use the malware’s functionality to download the Phobos payload and exfiltrate  data from the compromised system. The Windows command shell enables threat  actors to control various aspects of a system, with multiple permission levels required for different  subsets of commands [T1059.003][T1105].[8]             FBI | CISA | MS-ISAC   Page 3 of 18  |  Product ID: AA24-060A  TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Smokeloader Deployment  Phobos operations feature a standard three phase process to decrypt a payload that allows the threat  actors to deploy additional destructive malware.[9]  For the first phase, Smokeloader manipulates either VirtualAlloc or VirtualProtect API  functions—which opens an entry point, enabling code to be injected into running processes and  allowing the malware to evade network defense tools [T1055.002]. Finally, once Smokeloader reaches its third stage, it unpacks a program-erase cycle from stored  memory, which is then sent to be extracted from a SHA 256 hash as a payload.[7] Following  successful payload decryption, the threat actors can begin downloading additional malware.

Table 2:  Warzone RAT ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Initial Access  Technique Title  ID  Use  Phishing: Spearphishing  Attachment  T1566.001  Warzone RAT has been distributed as a  malicious attachment within an email. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. TLP: CLEAR  TLP: CLEAR  15 February 2024  MU-000174-MW    Identification and Disruption of the Warzone Remote  Access Trojan (RAT)      Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this FLASH to disseminate indicators of  compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Warzone  Remote Access Trojan (RAT), also identified as “Ave Maria” through open-source reporting and  FBI investigation. Beginning in October 2018, the Warzone service offered a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) remote  access trojan, along with other malware products and attracted a customer database of over  7,000 users. The Warzone service offered multiple associated malware products, including a premium RAT  called “Poison” with advanced features such as a rootkit to hide processes, files, and startup;  premium customer support; and premium Dynamic Domain Name System (DDnS) services. The Microsoft  exploits, which allowed malware to be embedded into a .doc or Excel file, exploited the  reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), in particular CVE-2017-8570, CVE- 2017-11882, and CVE-2018-0802. The  malware was often also distributed with or through malicious Microsoft Office files (T1221),  which exploit Microsoft CVE-2017-11882, a CVE that has been in multiple Top Routinely  Exploited Vulnerabilities reports coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency’s (CISA), the FBI, the NSA and FVEY partners. Persistence       During installation, the malware gains persistence by copying itself to  C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ and creating a registry key with a value set to the location of  Warzone’s executable binary to enable automatic execution of the code after each machine  reboot. Communication      The malware communicates with C2 servers via TCP over a configurable port which defaults to  port 5200. Variations in the C2  communications could be attributable to the progressive versions of the malware sold by the  developers. After decrypting the communication and connecting with the C2 server, the  malware collects basic system information about the compromised host, such as PC name and  operating system, and sends it back to the C2 server. Indicators of Compromise  The following are strings that can be used to identify and detect unpacked Warzone payload  inside memory:     •  “warzone160\x00”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server   •  “Ave_Maria Stealer”   o String in the binary code of the RAT   •  “nevergonnagiveyouup”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server      The following are other embedded communication passwords identified through the FBI’s  analysis of data associated with the malware:   •  “warzoneTURBO”  •  “MushroomFunguy”  •  “doghoroscopes”           Recommended Mitigations:  The FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise:  Preparing for Cyber Incidents:  • Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. Protective Controls and Architecture:  • Segment networks to prevent the spread of malware or actor traversal. Network  segmentation can help prevent the spread of malware by controlling traffic flows  between, and access to, various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral  movement. To aid in detecting malware and actor activity,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network."
"Risk Management for Electronic Ballot Delivery, Marking, and Return",2024-02-14,1,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 1, 'malware': 4}","Use encryption where possible (e.g., implement STARTTLS on your email servers to create a secure connection,  encrypt attached files, etc.)  Implement Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to help identify  phishing emails.

Furthermore, email is  often used in cyberattacks on organizations, such as attackers sending messages with malicious links or attachments  to infect computers with malware. This malware could spread to other machines on the network if strong network  segmentation techniques are not used. Utilize anti-malware detection and encourage voters to as well.

In addition to new TTPs that include more sophisticated  social engineering techniques, the advisory describes additional malware and ransomware variants  used to exfiltrate data and encrypt targeted organizations’ systems. Update July 29, 2025:  RattyRAT  Java-based remote access trojan, used for persistent, stealth access and  internal reconnaissance.4  DragonForce Ransomware  Infiltrates networks, encrypts data, and demands ransom. Scattered Spider threat actors have observably exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and  threatened to release it without deploying ransomware. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat  actors may have deployed DragonForce ransomware onto targeted organizations’ networks—thereby  encrypting VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. ▪  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. ▪  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, leverage a tool  that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the  ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complain  Center (IC3), a local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7  Operations Center at SOC@mail.cisa.dhs.gov or 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). 2 Tim Parisi, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and  BPO Companies,” Crowdstrike (blog), Crowdstrike, last modified December 1, 2022,  https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/;   Crowdstrike Intelligence Team, SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security Deficiencies with Bring-Your- Own-Vulnerable-Driver Tactic in Attempt to Bypass Endpoint Security, Crowdstrike (blog), Crowdstrike, last  modified January 19, 2023, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid- detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/; and Christopher Boyd, “Ransomware group steps  up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise,” ThreatDown Intelligence (blog), Malwarebytes, last  modified September 18, 2023, https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware- group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise. 3 Boyd, “Ransomware group steps up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise.”   4 Ayelen Torello, “Emulating the Unyielding Scattered Spider,” AttackIQ (blog), AttackIQ, last modified May  29, 2025, https://www.attackiq.com/2025/05/29/emulating-scattered-spider/.

The Interlock ransomware variant was first observed in late September 2024, targeting various business,  critical infrastructure, and other organizations in North America and Europe. FBI is aware of Interlock  ransomware encryptors designed for both Windows and Linux operating systems; these encryptors have  been observed encrypting virtual machines (VMs) across both operating systems. FBI observed actors  obtaining initial access via drive-by download from compromised legitimate websites, which is an  uncommon method among ransomware groups. FBI, CISA, HHS, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Interlock ransomware incidents. Overview  Since September 2024, Interlock ransomware actors have impacted a wide range of businesses and  critical infrastructure sectors in North America and Europe. TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | HHS | MS-ISAC  Page 3 of 19 | Product ID: AA25-203A  TLP:CLEAR  The authoring agencies are aware of emerging open-source reporting detailing similarities between the  Rhysida and Interlock ransomware variants.0F1 For additional information on Rhysida ransomware, see the  joint advisory, #StopRansomware: Rhysida Ransomware. Initial Access  FBI has observed Interlock actors obtaining initial access [TA0001] via drive-by download [T1189] from  compromised legitimate websites, an atypical method for ransomware actors. Interlock ransomware  methods for initial access have previously disguised malicious payloads as fake Google Chrome or  Microsoft Edge browser updates, though a cybersecurity company recently reported a shift to payload  filenames masquerading as updates for common security software (see Table 3 and Table 4 for a list of  filenames).1F2  In some instances, FBI has observed Interlock actors using the ClickFix social engineering technique, in  which unsuspecting users are prompted to execute a malicious payload by clicking a fake Completely  Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) [T1189]. According to open source reporting, the credential stealer collects login  information and associated URLs for victims’ online accounts [T1555.003], while the keylogger dynamic  link library (DLL) logs users’ keystrokes in a file named conhost.txt [T1036.005].6F7 As of February 2025,  private cybersecurity analysts also observed Interlock ransomware infections executing different versions  of information stealers [TA0006], including Lumma Stealer7F8 and Berserk Stealer, to harvest credentials for  lateral movement and privilege escalation [T1078].8F9  Interlock actors leverage compromised credentials and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)9F10 [T1021.001] to  move between systems. FBI has observed Interlock ransomware encryptors for both Windows  and Linux operating systems. In addition, cybersecurity  researchers have identified Interlock ransomware samples using a FreeBSD ELF encryptor [T1486], a  departure from usual Linux encryptors designed for VMware ESXi servers and VMs.13F14   A cybersecurity company identified a DLL binary named tmp41.wasd—executed after encryption using  rundll32.exe [T1218.011]—which uses the remove() function to delete the encryption binary  [T1070.004];14F15 on Linux machines, the encryptor uses a similar technique to execute the removeme  function. The ransom note provides each victim  with a unique code and instructions to contact the ransomware actors via a .onion URL. The actors threaten to  publish the victim’s exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network unless the victim pays the ransom  demand; the actors have previously followed through on this threat.15F16  Leveraged Tools  See Table 2 for publicly available tools and applications used by Interlock ransomware actors.

Mitigations  The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your  organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Interlock ransomware actors’ activity. At-risk organizations should implement the following mitigations:    Prevent Interlock ransomware actors from obtaining initial access:  o Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering to block users from accessing malicious sites  and applications.   Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. o Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows  between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware [CPG 3.A] with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 2.T]. o To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic,  including lateral movement activity on a network. Resources    Stopransomware.gov: Whole-of-government, central location for ransomware resources and alerts.   #StopRansomware Guide: Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack.   Cyber Hygiene Services, Ransomware Readiness Assessment: CISA’s no-cost cyber hygiene  services.

Ransom notes do not include an initial  ransom demand or payment instructions; rather, victims are instructed to contact the threat actors via  email. Impact  Update June 4, 2025:  The Play ransomware group uses a double extortion model [T1657], encrypting systems after exfiltrating  data. If a victim refuses to pay the ransom demand, the ransomware actors threaten to publish  exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network ([.]onion URL). Financial Theft   T1657  Play ransomware actors use a double-extortion model for  financial gain. TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA23-352A          #StopRansomware: Play Ransomware    Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories  for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These  #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. Note: Updates to this advisory, originally published December 18, 2023, include:  ▪  June 4, 2025: The advisory was updated to reflect new TTPs employed by Play ransomware group,  as well as provide current IOCs/remove outdated IOCs for effective threat hunting. Update June 4, 2025:  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) are releasing this joint  advisory to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations  as recently as January 2025. End Update  Since June 2022, the Play (also known as Playcrypt) ransomware group has impacted a wide range of  businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. Play ransomware was  among the most active ransomware groups in 2024. Organizations should take the following actions today to mitigate cyber threats from Play ransomware:  ▪  Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Update June 4, 2025:  As of May 2025, FBI was aware of approximately 900 affected entities allegedly exploited by the  ransomware actors. End Update  In Australia, the first Play ransomware incident was observed in April 2023, and most recently in November  2023. The Play ransomware group is presumed to be a closed group, designed to “guarantee the secrecy of  deals,” according to a statement on the group’s data leak website. End Update  FBI, CISA, and ASD’s ACSC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | ACSC  Page 3 of 18 | Product ID: AA23-352A  TLP:CLEAR  Initial Access  The Play ransomware group gains initial access to victim networks through the abuse of valid accounts,  likely purchased on the dark web [T1078], and exploitation of public-facing applications [T1190],  specifically through known FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812) and Microsoft Exchange  (ProxyNotShell [CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082]) vulnerabilities. Play ransomware actors have  been observed using external-facing services [T1133] such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual  Private Networks (VPN) for initial access. Update June 4, 2025:  Multiple ransomware groups, including initial access brokers with ties to Play ransomware operators,  exploited three vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-57727—in remote monitoring and management (RMM)  tool SimpleHelp [T1190] to conduct remote code execution [T1059.001] at many U.S.-based entities  following the vulnerabilities’ disclosure on 16 January 2025. End Update  Discovery and Defense Evasion  Play ransomware actors use tools like AdFind to run Active Directory queries [TA0007] and Grixba,1 an  information-stealer, to enumerate network information [T1016] and scan for anti-virus software  [T1518.001]. In some instances, cybersecurity researchers have  observed Play ransomware actors using PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender.2  Lateral Movement and Execution  Play ransomware actors use command and control (C2) applications, including Cobalt Strike and  SystemBC, and tools like PsExec to assist with lateral movement and file execution. Once established on a  network, the ransomware actors search for unsecured credentials [T1552] and use the Mimikatz  credential dumper to gain domain administrator access [T1003]. According to open source reporting,3 to  further enumerate vulnerabilities, Play ransomware actors use Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome  Scripts (WinPEAS) [T1059] to search for additional privilege escalation paths. Exfiltration and Encryption  Update June 4, 2025:  The Play ransomware binary is recompiled for every attack, resulting in unique hashes for each  deployment, complicating anti-malware and anti-virus program detection of the ransomware [T1027]. End Update  Play ransomware actors often split compromised data into segments and use tools like WinRAR to  compress files [T1560.001] into .RAR format for exfiltration. The ransom note directs victims to contact the Play ransomware group at an email address ending in  @gmx[.]de or @web[.]de. Play ransomware targets regularly receive phone calls from threat actors encouraging payment and  threatening the release of company information. ESXi Variant   The ESXi variant of Play ransomware invokes shell commands specific to the ESXi environment to conduct  tasks, including powering off all running Virtual Machines (VMs), listing machines names, and setting the  welcome message of the ESXi interface to the campaign-specific ransom note. The ransomware binary  supports command line arguments; however, if no command line arguments are passed, the malware  powers off all VMs and encrypts files related to VMs using randomly generated per-file keys. The ransomware binary employs AES-256 as its encryption algorithm. Like the Windows variant of Play ransomware, the ESXi variant must be recompiled for each campaign. Leveraged Tools  Table 1 lists legitimate tools Play ransomware actors have repurposed for their operations. Tools Leveraged by Play Ransomware Actors  Name  Description  AdFind  Used to query and retrieve information from Active Directory.

FBI, CISA, and  ASD’s ACSC recommend that software manufacturers incorporate secure by design and default principles  and tactics into their software development practices to limit the impact of ransomware techniques (such  as threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities into remote software systems), thus, strengthening the  security posture for their customers. If unable to  patch, then disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) until updates are able to be undertaken.6   ▪  Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.7  ▪  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network [CPG  1.E]. Resources  ▪  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts. ▪  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: #StopRansomware Guide. ▪  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to  promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center  (IC3), or CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or 888-282-0870). Australian organizations that have been impacted or require assistance in regard to a ransomware incident  can contact ASD's ACSC via 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371), or by submitting a report to cyber.gov.au.

Threat  SRG has been operating since 2022 and has primarily been known for their callback phishing  emails, masquerading as well-known businesses who offer subscription plans. Typically, SRG  phishing emails purport to charge small amounts of “subscription fees” as they are less likely to     TLP:CLEAR  generate immediate suspicion. Similar to their phishing emails posing as a company with a subscription, once SRG exfiltrates  data, they extort the victim by sending them a ransom email threatening to sell or post the data  online. For SRG threat actors:   Conduct staff training on resisting phishing attempts   Develop and communicate policies surrounding when and how company’s IT will  authenticate themselves with employees   Maintain regular backups of company data   Implement two-factor authentication for all employees       Information Requested  The FBI is seeking any information from SRG victims that can be legally shared, including:   Ransom Note copy   Phone number used by Threat Actor   Communications with Threat Actor to include voicemails   Cryptocurrency wallet information   Special sensitivities of stolen data   Original call back message or phishing email    Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to FBI in response  to this product.

From the moment data is ingested for use with AI systems, the data acquirer must  secure it against insider threats and malicious network activity to prevent unauthorized  modification. These poisoning techniques should be considered viable threats by  anyone looking to incorporate web-scale data into their AI systems. Challenges like adversarial machine learning threats, statistical bias, and  inaccurate information can impact the overall security of AI-driven outcomes. Risk: Adversarial Machine Learning threats  Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) threats involve intentional, malicious attempts to  deceive, manipulate, or disrupt AI systems. There are many potential causes of data drift, including:    A change in the upstream data pipeline not represented in the model training  data (e.g., the units of a particular data element change from miles to kilometers)   The introduction of completely new data elements that the model had not  previously seen (e.g., a new type of malware not recognized in the ML layer of an  anti-virus product)   A change in the context of how inputs and outputs are related (e.g., a change in  organizational structure due to a merger or acquisition could lead to new data  access patterns that might be misinterpreted as security threats by an AI system)  The data associated with a given AI model should be regularly checked for any updates  to help ensure the model still predicts as expected. Data security is an ever-evolving field, and continuous vigilance and adaptation are key  to staying ahead of emerging threats and vulnerabilities. 1.0  20  AI Data Security  TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  mitigation strategies, organizations can fortify their AI systems against potential threats  and safeguard sensitive, proprietary, and mission critical data used in the development  and operation of their AI systems.

LummaC2 malware is able to infiltrate victim computer networks and exfiltrate  sensitive information, threatening vulnerable individuals’ and organizations’ computer networks across  multiple U.S. The IOCs included in this advisory were  associated with LummaC2 malware infections from November 2023 through May 2025. The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of  this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of LummaC2 malware. May 21, 2025   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA  Page 2 of 14 | Product ID: AA25-141B  TLP:CLEAR  Overview  LummaC2 malware first appeared for sale on multiple Russian-language speaking cybercriminal forums in  2022. To obfuscate their operations, threat actors have embedded and distributed LummaC2 malware within  spoofed or fake popular software (i.e., multimedia player or utility software) [T1036]. Once a victim’s computer system is infected, the malware can exfiltrate sensitive user information,  including personally identifiable information, financial credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, browser  extensions, and multifactor authentication (MFA) details without immediate detection [TA0010, T1119]. Message Box  If the user selects No, the malware will exit. If the user selects Yes, the malware will move on to its next  routine, which decrypts its callback Command and Control (C2) domains [T1140]. Code Saving Successful Callback Request  Once a valid C2 domain is contacted and saved, the malware moves on to the next routine, which queries  the user’s name and computer name utilizing the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  GetUserNameW and GetComputerNameW respectively [T1012]. This is most  likely a failsafe to prevent the malware from running on the attacker’s system, as its algorithms are one- way only and will not reveal information on the details of the attacker’s own hostname and username. If the username and hostname check function returns zero (does not match the hard-coded values), the  malware will enter its main callback routine. The LummaC2 malware will contact the saved hostname from  the previous check and send the following POST request (see Figure 6). Once decoded, the C2 data is in a JSON format and is  parsed by the LummaC2 malware. Take Screenshot  If the configuration JSON file has a key of “se” and its value is “true,” the malware will take a screenshot  in BMP format and upload it to the C2 server. Delete Self  If the configuration JSON file has a key of “ad” and its value is “true,” the malware will enter a routine to  delete itself. Decoded Command Line in Memory  Host Modifications  Without any C2 interactions, the LummaC2 malware does not create any files on the infected drive.

Phishing is often the first step in a larger and more complex cyber  compromise. Phishing is typically used to trick victims into revealing sensitive  information (such as login passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data), but can  also be used to distribute malware or exploit system vulnerabilities. Monitor for signs of phishing activities, such as suspicious emails, websites, or  links, and correlate these with fast flux activity.

Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets. FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa  actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid and requested half of the  payment be made again to provide the “true decryptor”— potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme.

The Medusa ransomware variant is unrelated to the MedusaLocker variant and the  Medusa mobile malware variant per the FBI’s investigation. FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents. Background  The RaaS Medusa variant has been used to conduct ransomware attacks from 2021 to present. Medusa  originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations  were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Resources    Joint #StopRansomware Guide. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC  urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a local  FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center  (report@cisa.gov) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing  and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint advisory to disseminate known Ghost (Cring)— (“Ghost”)—ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified  through FBI investigation as recently as January  2025. Ghost actors rotate their ransomware executable payloads, switch file extensions for encrypted files,  modify ransom note text, and use numerous ransom email addresses, which has led to variable attribution  of this group over time. Samples of ransomware files Ghost used during attacks are:  Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Ghost ransomware incidents. In multiple instances, they have been observed proceeding from initial compromise to the  deployment of ransomware within the same day. Impact and Encryption  Ghost actors use Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe, which are all ransomware  executables that share similar functionality. The nature of executables’ operability is based on command line  arguments used when executing the ransomware file. These ransomware payloads clear Windows Event Logs [T1070.001], disable the Volume Shadow Copy  Service, and delete shadow copies to inhibit system recovery attempts [T1490]. Data encrypted with Ghost  ransomware variants cannot be recovered without the decryption key. The impact of Ghost ransomware activity varies widely on a victim-to-victim basis.

Table 13: Impact  Technique Title   ID  Use  Data Encrypted for  Impact  T1486  Ghost actors use ransomware variants Cring.exe, Ghost.exe,  ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe to encrypt victim files for ransom. Mitigations  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations reference their #StopRansomware Guide and  implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Ghost ransomware  activity. Ghost ransomware victims whose backups were unaffected by the  ransomware attack were often able to restore operations without needing to contact Ghost actors  or pay a ransom. Ransomware activity generates  unusual network traffic across all phases of the attack chain. Organizations that can successfully identify and investigate this activity  are better able to interrupt malicious activity before ransomware is executed [CPG 3.A]. Victims who have identified and responded to this  unusual behavior have successfully prevented Ghost ransomware attacks. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you  to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), a local FBI Field  Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov)  or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). CISA and NIST  based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common  and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Execution  Ghost actors have been observed uploading a web shell [T1505.003] to a compromised server and  leveraging Windows Command Prompt [T1059.003] and/or PowerShell [T1059.001] to download and  execute Cobalt Strike Beacon malware [T1105] that is then implanted on victim systems. Command and Control  Ghost actors rely heavily on Cobalt Strike Beacon malware and Cobalt Strike Team Servers for command  and control (C2) operations, which function using hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and hypertext transfer  protocol secure (HTTPS) [T1071.001]. Instead, connections made to a uniform resource identifier (URI) of a C2 server, for the purpose of  downloading and executing Beacon malware, directly reference the C2 server’s IP address. Table 5: Execution  Technique Title   ID  Use  Windows  Management  Instrumentation  T1047  Ghost actors abuse WMI to run PowerShell scripts on other devices,  resulting in their infection with Cobalt Strike Beacon malware.

Product Security Bad Practices,2025-01-17,1,"{'phishing': 5, 'threats_of_violence': 1}","  Added that software manufacturers should  support phishing-resistant MFA.   Providing time-limited setup passwords that disable themselves when a setup process is  complete and require configuration of a secure password (or more secure authentication  approaches, such as phishing-resistant MFA). Resources: OWASP Hardcoded Password, OWASP Secrets Management   TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  8  CISA | FBI  Security Features  9) For use in service of critical infrastructure or national critical functions, Information technology (IT)  products that do not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), including phishing-resistant MFA, in  the baseline version of the product are dangerous and significantly elevate risk to national security,  national economic security, and national public health and safety. Note: Other phishing-resistant forms of authentication, such as passkeys, meet this definition even if  they are the sole form of authentication. Recommended action: For all products besides excepted OT products listed above, software  manufacturers should either support MFA, including phishing-resistant MFA, natively in the product  (if the product itself handles authentication) or support the use of an external identity provider in the  baseline version of the product, such as via standards-based single sign on. For OT products where MFA use may introduce safety risks (e.g., on medical devices in emergency  rooms where delay in physician access could lead to patient harm), manufacturers should employ  authentication measures that effectively mitigate the threat of single-factor credential abuse and  other authentication threats."
Secure by Demand: Priority Considerations for Operational Technology Owners and Operators when Selecting Digital Products,2025-01-13,1,"{'phishing': 4, 'threats_of_violence': 11}","Strong Authentication: The baseline version of the product, especially safety-critical equipment,  protects against unauthorized access through appropriate control measures, including role-based  access control and phishing-resistant multifactor authentication. Phishing-resistant MFA  Buyers should seek products with RBAC and ABAC rather than relying on common accounts. Buyers should look for products with phishing-resistant MFA included in the baseline version. Phishing-resistant MFA is a key security control for  limiting the damage a threat actor can do in an OT environment. By rigorously enforcing purchasing decisions that require and prioritize the purchase of products that  enforce these elements, critical infrastructure organizations can help mitigate current and emerging cyber  threats to critical infrastructure and create a path away from legacy environments. It is difficult  and costly for asset owners to defend themselves against these threats if security is not considered and  implemented in the design and development of their OT products. The priority elements were selected to mitigate current cyber threats to OT and adhere to common legal  requirements to encourage business practices that empower asset owners to recover the infrastructure  they are responsible for and develop foundational security elements that are uncommon in OT. By ensuring the deployment of secure products on their networks, critical infrastructure owners and  operators can reduce the potential damage from cyber threats and protect their systems from exploitation. Secure by Default  Selection criteria: The product is delivered secure out of the box, resilient against the most prevalent  threats and vulnerabilities, without requiring additional configuration from users or administrators. The goal of this consideration is to configure security into OT products such that protection against the  most prevalent threats is included by default at no additional cost to the buyer.   Including default configurations that protect against prevalent threats. Buyers should seek out threat models that track and incorporate threat sources, such as MITRE EMB3D,  so that threats are aligned with modern threat actor capabilities. Public threat sources allow manufacturers  to communicate threats and mitigations using a shared language, making it simpler for buyers to  understand how a product fits into their overall security model. Manufacturers that document and update threat models, hardening  guidance and secure lifecycle development, are more likely to build products that will be resilient against  both known and emerging threats. Why this matters: Patches are an excellent way to protect against known threats."
