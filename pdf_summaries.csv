Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Leverage SolarWinds Vulnerabilities,2020-12-29,4,"{'threats_of_violence': 3, 'malware': 6}","Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Leverage  SolarWinds Vulnerabilities  Summary  Based on the wide ranging scope of the investigation into SolarWinds  Orion compromises by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors and  fast paced release of private network analysis, the FBI is providing  cyber security professionals and system administrators collated and  verified information to assist in determining whether APT actors have  exploited the SolarWinds vulnerabilities present on their systems. Threat Details  Malicious actors are exploiting SolarWinds Orion products (affected  versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1) containing SUNBURST malware  to gain access to network traffic management systems. Once the  malicious update is found on a network, cyber security professionals and system administrators must  determine whether the threat actor has used that vulnerability to pivot to a higher form of access. Recommendations  If an entity determines that they have downloaded the trojanized SolarWinds plug-in, they should  conduct additional research to determine whether or not their systems have been further  compromised. After installation, the malware beacons via DNS requests to resolve unique subdomains  of avsvmcloud[.]com between 12 and 14 days after installation, according to FireEye’s reporting. The malware operators are able to monitor the DNS beacons to determine if additional targeting of an  organization is desired. Some victims may have received a response that included an IP address designed to disable the  malware. Following receipt of a DNS response  indicating the network was to be further targeted, the malware moved additional communications to a  separate command and control address which would also make victim specific DNS queries."

DoppelPaymer Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Impact Critical Services,2020-12-15,4,"{'extortion': 2, 'ransomware': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 4, 'malware': 1}","Prior to infecting systems with ransomware,  the actors’ exfiltrate data to use in extortion schemes and have made  follow-on telephone calls to victims to further pressure them to make  ransom payments. After German authorities contacted the actors through the provided  communication accounts, the actors withdrew the extortion attempt and provided a digital decryption  key upon learning patients’ lives were endangered, according to open source reporting about the  German investigation. DoppelPaymer Ransomware Attacks on  Critical Infrastructure Impact Critical Services   Summary  Since late August 2019, unidentified actors have used DoppelPaymer  ransomware to encrypt data from victims within critical industries  worldwide such as healthcare, emergency services, and education,  interrupting citizens’ access to services. Since its emergence in June  2019, DoppelPaymer ransomware has infected a variety of industries  and targets, with actors routinely demanding six- and seven-figure  ransoms in Bitcoin (BTC). Threat Details  DoppelPaymer ransomware attacks since June 2019 have negatively  impacted the provision of healthcare, emergency, and education  services to citizens worldwide. This individual later died, though  German authorities ultimately did not hold the ransomware actors responsible because the German  authorities felt the individual’s health was poor and the patient likely would have died even if they had  not been re-routed. In July 2019, DoppelPaymer actors infected 13 out of 380 servers used by an identified US medical  center with ransomware. The medical center required several weeks to restore their  systems from offsite backups following the ransomware attack. The ransomware was introduced via an Internet  Explorer/Edge browser after an employee viewed a cryptocurrency website. The ransomware was successful in encrypting files stored on the following platforms: Windows 7,  Windows 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, and Server 2016. Additional Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures  Doppelpaymer is one of the first ransomware variants where actors have called the victims to entice  payments. As of February 2020, in multiple instances, DoppelPaymer actors had followed ransomware  infections with calls to the victims to extort payments through intimidation or threatening to release  exfiltrated data. Paying a ransom may embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the  ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office or the FBI’s Internet  Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical information they need  to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. In one case an actor, using a spoofed US-based telephone number while claiming to be  located in North Korea, threatened to leak or sell data from an identified business if the business did  not pay the ransom. During subsequent telephone calls to the same business, the actor threatened to  send an individual to the home of an employee and provided the employee's home address. The  malware infected servers at three of the college’s campuses but did not infect cloud-based  applications."
Cyber Actors Target K-12 Distance Learning Education to Cause Disruptions and Steal Data,2020-12-11,4,"{'phishing': 3, 'ransomware': 11, 'threats_of_violence': 4, 'malware': 8}","Tactics, such as phishing, trick victims into revealing  personal information (e.g., password or bank account information) or performing a task (e.g., clicking  on a link). These types of attacks are referred to  as Domain Spoofing or Homograph attacks. Because end users are targeted, make employees and  students aware of the threats—such as ransomware and phishing scams—and how they  are delivered. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC assess malicious cyber actors are targeting kindergarten through  twelfth grade (K-12) educational institutions, leading to ransomware attacks, the theft of data, and  the disruption of distance learning services. Ransomware  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC have received numerous reports of ransomware attacks against K-12  educational institutions. Adopting tactics previously leveraged against business and industry,  ransomware actors have also stolen—and threatened to leak—confidential student data to the public  unless institutions pay a ransom. According to MS-ISAC data, the percentage of reported ransomware incidents against K-12 schools  increased at the beginning of the 2020 school year. In August and September, 57% of ransomware  incidents reported to the MS-ISAC involved K-12 schools, compared to 28% of all reported  ransomware incidents from January through July. Open/Exposed Ports  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC frequently see malicious cyber actors exploiting exposed Remote  Desktop Protocol (RDP) services to gain initial access to a network and, often, to manually deploy  ransomware. Ransomware Best Practices  The FBI and CISA do not recommend paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other  criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However,  regardless of whether your organization decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report  ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical  information they need to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and  holding them accountable under US law. THREAT DETAILS  As of December 2020, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC continue to receive reports from K-12  educational institutions about the disruption of distance learning efforts by cyber actors. The FBI and CISA suggest K-12 educational institutions review or  establish patching plans, security policies, user agreements, and business continuity plans to ensure  they address current threats posed by cyber actors. Malware  Figure 1 identifies the top 10 malware strains that have affected state, local, tribal, and territorial  (SLTT) educational institutions over the past year (up to and including September 2020). Note: These  malware variants are purely opportunistic as they not only affect educational institutions but other  organizations as well. ZeuS and Shlayer are among the most prevalent malware affecting K-12 schools.   ZeuS is a Trojan with several variants that targets Microsoft Windows operating systems.   Shlayer is a Trojan downloader and dropper for MacOS malware.1 It is primarily distributed  through malicious websites, hijacked domains, and malicious advertising posing as a fake  Adobe Flash updater. Figure 1: Top 10 malware affecting SLTT educational institutions  Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks  Cyber actors are causing disruptions to K-12 educational institutions—including third-party  services supporting distance learning—with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,2  which temporarily limit or prevent users from conducting daily operations. In such scenarios, a victim could receive what appears to be legitimate email that:    Requests personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., full name, birthdate, student ID),     Directs the user to confirm a password or personal identification number (PIN),     Instructs the recipient to visit a website that is compromised by the cyber actor, or     Contains an attachment with malware. They are then positioned to move laterally throughout a network  (often using SMB), escalate privileges, access and exfiltrate sensitive information, harvest  credentials, or deploy a wide variety of malware."
Addressing Risks Associated with Rail Industrial Internet of Things and Commercial Off-the-Shelf System Solutions,2020-12-08,4,"{'ransomware': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 5, 'malware': 4}","For example, the WannaCry ransomware targeted internet-connected  Windows 7 operating systems, impacting victims across multiple industries, including the  German rail sector. Additionally, cyber actors could deploy malware or execute  ransomware on devices capable of spreading throughout all connected rail infrastructure  networks, enabling theft of customer and employee data, physical disruptions, or the theft of  intellectual property. TLP:WHITE    TLP:WHITE  COTS IoT in Industrial Networks  The increased integration of new devices and COTS systems increases potential entry points  malicious cyber actors or advanced persistent threats may attempt to exploit, which enables  cyber actors to more easily target multiple industries. Recent malicious cyber activity against  US rail entities demonstrates the importance of proactively addressing the cyber threat posed  to IIoT devices and solutions as rail entities continue to streamline and modernize operations.  If a vulnerability arises in a COTS system installed on or used by multiple rail networks,  cyber threat actors may be able to exploit the vulnerability to target multiple victims in  one attack. The ongoing evolution of the  cyber criminal threat increases the importance of proactively addressing cyber risk in critical  infrastructure networks. In addition to standard cybersecurity best practices and insider threat countermeasures, the  FBI has developed the following set of mitigation strategies and proactive measures that may  help freight and passenger rail companies protect the connected rail devices from  unauthorized access and exploitation. Remote accessibility increases the number of potential intrusion vectors a  malicious cyber actor could exploit for stealing data or introducing malware. While most of the cyber incidents only disrupted minor  operations, led to monetary losses, or resulted in malware being introduced into rail company  computer networks, one incident in Lodz, Poland, resulted in train derailments.c The most  recent breach, which occurred in August 2020, prevented a US transportation authority from  sharing travel information with its customers. To mitigate the spread of malware, the US  transportation authority temporarily shut down its real-time travel data sharing service and  suspended employee email, payroll, and remote timekeeping capabilities."

This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by  cybercriminals against targets in the Healthcare and Public Health Sector (HPH) to infect systems  with ransomware, notably Ryuk and Conti, for financial gain. Key Findings    CISA, FBI, and HHS assess malicious cyber actors are targeting the HPH Sector with TrickBot  and BazarLoader malware, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption  of healthcare services. These activities include  credential harvesting, mail exfiltration, cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the  deployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk and Conti. Campaigns using  Bazar represent a new technique for cybercriminals to infect and monetize networks and have  increasingly led to the deployment of ransomware, including Ryuk. BazarLoader has become one of  the most commonly used vectors for ransomware deployment. In other parts of the  ransomware code, Ryuk has removed or replaced features of Hermes, such as the restriction against  targeting specific Eurasia-based systems. In addition, the attackers will attempt to shut down or uninstall security applications on the victim  systems that might prevent the ransomware from executing. The RyukReadMe file placed on the system after encryption provides either one or two email   addresses, using the end-to-end encrypted email provider Protonmail, through which the victim can                                                  2 See the United Kingdom (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advisory, Ryuk Ransomware Targeting  Organisations Globally, on their ongoing investigation into global Ryuk ransomware campaigns and associated  Emotet and TrickBot malware. Ransomware Best Practices  CISA, FBI and HHS do not recommend paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other  criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. CISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations implement both ransomware  prevention and ransomware response meaures immediately. It is important that backups be  maintained offline or in separated networks as many ransomware variants attempt to find and  delete any accessible backups.   Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated  communications plan that includes response and notification procedures for a ransomware  incident.   The Ransomware Response Checklist, available in the CISA and MS-ISAC Joint  Ransomware Guide, serves as an adaptable, ransomware- specific annex to organizational  cyber incident response or disruption plans.   Legacy devices should be identified and inventoried with highest priority and given special  consideration during a ransomware event.   See CISA and MS-ISAC's Joint Ransomware Guide for additional in-depth hardening  guidance. Contact CISA for These No-Cost Resources    Information sharing with CISA and MS-ISAC (for SLTT organizations) includes bi-directional  sharing of best practices and network defense information regarding ransomware trends and  variants as well as malware that is a precursor to ransomware.   Cyber exercises evaluate or help develop a cyber incident response plan in the context of a  ransomware incident scenario. Should your organization be a victim of ransomware, CISA strongly recommends responding by using  the Ransomware Response Checklist located in CISA and MS-ISAC's Joint Ransomware Guide,  which contains steps for detection and analysis as well as containment and eradication.

TLP: WHITE Product ID: AA20-296B October 22, 2020 TLP:WHITE  Iranian State-Sponsored Advanced Persistent  Threat Actors Threaten Election-Related  Systems  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) are warning that Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) actors are likely intent on influencing  and interfering with the U.S.   A SQL injection involves a threat actor inserting malicious code into the entry field of an  application, causing that code to execute if entries have not been sanitized.   Public-facing website defacements typically involve a cyber threat actor compromising the  website or its associated CMS, allowing the actor to upload images to the site’s landing page. Automating updates and  patches is critical because of the speed at which threat actors create exploits after a patch is  released. Without rapid and thorough patch application, threat actors can operate inside  a defender’s patch cycle.3 In addition to updating the application, use tools (e.g., the OWASP  Dependency-Check Project tool4) to identify publicly known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that  the application depends on.

Chinese Government-Mandated Tax Software  Contains Malware, Enabling Backdoor Access     Summary    The FBI seeks to inform US companies in the healthcare, chemical, and  finance sectors of potential targeting activity by the Chinese  government against their business and operational components based  in China. As early as March 2019, at least two Western companies  operating in China detected malware that was delivered through  Chinese vendors that were responsible for releasing tax software  upgrades following changes in 2018 to China’s value-added tax (VAT). The malware launched a backdoor into victim systems, which the FBI  assesses likely allows cyber actors to preposition to conduct remote  code execution and exfiltration activities on the victim’s network. In April 2019, employees of the pharmaceutical company discovered that the  software contained malware that created a backdoor on the company’s network. In June 2020, a private cybersecurity firm reported that Intelligence Tax, a tax software from Aisino  Corporation that is required by a Chinese bank under the same VAT system, likely contained  malware that installed a hidden backdoor to the networks of organizations using the tax software.

Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims,2021-11-01,4,"{'extortion': 4, 'ransomware': 19, 'threats_of_violence': 4, 'malware': 4}","TLP:WHITE   TLP:WHITE   01 November 2021  20211101-001  Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock  Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims     Summary  The FBI assesses ransomware actors are very likely using significant financial events, such as  mergers and acquisitions, to target and leverage victim companies for ransomware infections. During the initial reconnaissance phase,  cyber criminals identify non-publicly available information, which they threaten to release or  use as leverage during the extortion to entice victims to comply with ransom demands. Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers,  and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for  extortion where access is established.  In early 2020, a ransomware actor using the moniker “Unknown” made a post on the  Russian hacking forum “Exploit” that encouraged using the NASDAQ stock exchange to  influence the extortion process. Prior to an attack, ransomware actors research publicly available information, such as a victim’s  stock valuation, as well as material nonpublic information. If victims do not pay a ransom  quickly, ransomware actors will threaten to disclose this information publicly, causing potential  investor backlash. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE         Threat  Ransomware actors are targeting companies involved in significant, time-sensitive financial  events to incentivize ransom payment by these victims. Ransomware is often a two-stage  process beginning with an initial intrusion through a trojan malware, which allows an access  broker to perform reconnaissance and determine how to best monetize the access. However,  while this malware is often mass distributed, most victims of trojans are not also victims of  ransomware, indicating ransomware targets are often carefully selected from a pool based on  information gleaned from the initial reconnaissance. Following this posting, unidentified ransomware actors  negotiating a payment with a victim during a March 2020 ransomware event stated,  “We have also noticed that you have stocks.

Power-off and segregate any additional  computers or devices that share a network with the infected computer(s), even if  they have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not pay  the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack  on the victim company’s public facing website. If no ransom is paid, the threat actors  will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data broker. Once inside the network, the threat actor will use  publicly available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando,  or   PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and   Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption. • Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN  login credentials and change passwords and settings, if applicable.

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware attacks during non- business hours, especially holidays and weekends, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend  organizations:  •  Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. Refer to the CISA-Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide  for general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by ransomware attacks. Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology  networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-131A: DarkSide Ransomware:  Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more mitigations,  including mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity  fall victim to a ransomware attack. RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend:  •  Following the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State  Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Paying a  ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors  to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. •  CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a  tiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to  defend and recover from a ransomware incident. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for  all referenced threat actor tactics and  techniques. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is  free of malware."

RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS  The FBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA recommend WWS facilities—including DoD water treatment facilities  in the United States and abroad—use a risk-informed analysis to determine the applicability of a  range of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. Planning and Operational Mitigations  •  Ensure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of potential  impacts that cyberattacks pose to operations, including loss or manipulation of view, loss or  manipulation of control, and threats to safety. These are systems that physically prevent  dangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a threat actor. •  Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-to- date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network  assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware."

Cyber Criminal Actors Targeting the Food and Agriculture Sector with Ransomware Attacks,2021-09-07,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'extortion': 2, 'personal_data_breach': 1, 'ransomware': 18, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 3}","Although cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect  victims with ransomware, the most common means of infection are email phishing campaigns,  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, and software vulnerabilities. • In November 2020, a US-based international food and agriculture business reported it was  unable to access multiple computer systems tied to their network due to a ransomware attack  conducted by OnePercent Group threat actors using a phishing email with a malicious zip file  attachment. Larger businesses are targeted based on their perceived  ability to pay higher ransom demands, while smaller entities may be seen as soft targets, particularly  those in the earlier stages of digitizing their processes, according to a private industry report. This double extortion potentially gives the attacker more leverage  to ensure payment, based on the potential damage caused by a significant data breach of sensitive  information. Cyber Criminal Actors Targeting the Food  and Agriculture Sector with Ransomware  Attacks  Summary  Ransomware attacks targeting the Food and Agriculture sector disrupt  operations, cause financial loss, and negatively impact the food supply  chain. Ransomware may impact businesses across the sector, from  small farms to large producers, processors and manufacturers, and  markets and restaurants. Food and agriculture businesses victimized by ransomware suffer  significant financial loss resulting from ransom payments, loss of  productivity, and remediation costs. Companies may also experience  the loss of proprietary information and personally identifiable  information (PII) and may suffer reputational damage resulting from a  ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, victims’ files are encrypted and made unavailable, and the attacker  demands a payment for the decryption tool and key. The impact of ransomware attacks continues to grow. Separate studies have  shown 50-80 percent of victims that paid the ransom experienced a repeat ransomware attack by  either the same or different actors. Examples of ransomware attacks impacting food and agriculture sector businesses include the  following:  • In July 2021, a US bakery company lost access to their server, files, and applications, halting their  production, shipping, and receiving as a result of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware which was  deployed through software used by an IT support managed service provider (MSP). TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE  • In May 2021, cyber actors using a variant of the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware compromised  computer networks in the US and overseas locations of a global meat processing company, which  resulted in the possible exfiltration of company data and the shutdown of some US-based plants  for several days. • In March 2021, a US beverage company suffered a ransomware attack that caused significant  disruption to its business operations, including its operations, production, and shipping. The following steps can be implemented to mitigate the threat and protect  against ransomware attacks:  • Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional                                 TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. Regardless of  whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to promptly  report ransomware incidents to your local field office or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch). Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying  and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under U.S. Government’s new, official one-stop  location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively. Cyber criminal threat actors exploit network  vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data and encrypt systems in a sector that is  increasingly reliant on smart technologies, industrial control systems,  and internet-based automation systems. TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE    Threat Overview  The Food and Agriculture sector is among the critical infrastructure sectors increasingly targeted by  cyber attacks. Threat actors may apply additional coercive tactics such as convincing media  organizations to write stories on victim security incidents, harassing employees by phone, notifying  business partners of data theft, and conducting distributed denial of service attacks to further  disrupt operations. The  unidentified threat actor was able to target their internal servers by gaining administrator level  access through compromised credentials. Recommended Mitigations  Cyber criminal threat actors will continue to exploit network system vulnerabilities within the food  and agriculture sector. According to a private industry report, cyber actors may gradually broaden their  attack from just information technology (IT) and business processes to also include the operational  technology (OT) assets, which monitor and control physical processes, impacting industrial  production regardless of whether the malware was deployed in IT or OT systems. The  company took its systems offline to prevent the further spread of malware, directly impacting  employees who were unable to access specific systems, according to open source reports. • Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software on all hosts."

After DarkSide actors gained  access to the victim’s network, they deployed ransomware to encrypt victim data and—as a  secondary form of extortion—exfiltrated the data before threatening to publish it to further  pressure victims into paying the ransom demand. The number of  ransomware incidents also continues to rise, with 2,474 incidents reported in 2020, representing a 20  percent increase in the number of incidents, and a 225 percent increase in ransom demands. Cyber criminals  have also increasingly coupled initial encryption of data with a secondary form of extortion, in which  they threaten to publicly name affected victims and release sensitive or proprietary data exfiltrated                                                  1 This number includes only those victims who have provided information to IC3.

Cyber  criminals have increasingly targeted large, lucrative organizations and providers of critical services  with the expectation of higher value ransoms and increased likelihood of payments.   Gather information for follow-on attacks before deploying ransomware on the victim network. Threat actors can be  present on a victim network long before they lock down a system, alerting the victim to the  ransomware attack. Also  review the Ransomware Response Checklist in the CISA-MS-ISAC Joint Ransomware Guide. Cyber Hygiene Services  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services—including vulnerability scanning and  ransomware readiness assessments—to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify, and  reduce their exposure to cyber threats. RANSOMWARE BEST PRACTICES  The FBI and CISA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Government with  critical information needed to help victims, track ransomware attackers, hold attackers accountable  under U.S. RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS  The FBI and CISA highly recommend organizations continuously and actively monitor for ransomware  threats over holidays and weekends.2 Additionally, the FBI and CISA recommend identifying IT  security employees to be available and ""on call"" during these times, in the event of a ransomware  attack. It is important that backups be  maintained offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and delete or encrypt  accessible backups.   Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that:  o Includes procedures for response and notification in a ransomware incident and  o Plans for the possibility of critical systems being inaccessible for a period of time. Note: for help with developing your plan, review available incident response guidance, such  as the Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook and the Ransomware Response  Checklist in the CISA-MS-ISAC Joint Ransomware Guide. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the  following actions. Power off and segregate any other computers or devices  that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware. Government’s new,  official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively. The FBI and CISA do not currently have any  specific threat reporting indicating a cyberattack will  occur over the upcoming Labor Day holiday. THREAT OVERVIEW  Recent Holiday Targeting  Cyber actors have conducted increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. The FBI and CISA do not currently have specific information  regarding cyber threats coinciding with upcoming holidays and weekends. THREAT HUNTING  The FBI and CISA suggest organizations engage in preemptive threat hunting on their networks. Threat hunting is a proactive strategy to search for signs of threat actor activity to prevent attacks  before they occur or to minimize damage in the event of a successful attack. Threat actors often search through a network to find and compromise the most  critical or lucrative targets. Threat hunting encompasses  the following elements of understanding the IT environment by developing a baseline through a  behavior-based analytics approach, evaluating data logs, and installing automated alerting systems. Indicators of suspicious activity that threat hunters should look for include:    Unusual inbound and outbound network traffic,    Compromise of administrator privileges or escalation of the permissions on an account,    Theft of login and password credentials,    Substantial increase in database read volume,    Geographical irregularities in access and log in patterns,    Attempted user activity during anomalous logon times,     Attempts to access folders on a server that are not linked to the HTML within the pages of the  web server, and    Baseline deviations in the type of outbound encrypted traffic since advanced persistent threat  actors frequently encrypt exfiltration. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations. Precursor malware enables cyber actors to conduct  reconnaissance on victim networks, steal credentials, escalate privileges, exfiltrate information, move  laterally on the victim network, and obfuscate command-and-control communications. Payment may also embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of malware, and/or fund illicit activities.   Automatically update antivirus and anti-malware solutions and conduct regular virus and  malware scans. If possible, scan  your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. 1: Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and  Laptops    NIST SP 800-46 Rev."

The extortion/data leak typically  follows these steps:                                                               1 IcedID can also be delivered using TA551 (also known as Shathak and GoldCabin). Once the ransomware is successfully deployed, the victim will start to receive phone calls through spoofed  phone numbers with ransom demands and are provided a ProtonMail email address for further  communication. Indicators of Compromise Associated with OnePercent  Group Ransomware  Summary  The FBI has learned of a cyber-criminal group who self identifies as the  “OnePercent Group” and who have used Cobalt Strike to perpetuate  ransomware attacks against US companies since November 2020. While some of  these applications support legitimate purposes, they can also be used by threat actors to aid in system  compromise or exploration of a victim company’s enterprise network:                                                               2 Sodinokibi is a Russia-based ransomware-as-a-service group.

TLP: WHITE  TLP: WHITE  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or  warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of recipients in order to  protect against cyber threats. The actors contact the victims via telephone and email, threatening to  release the stolen data through The Onion Router (TOR) network and clearnet,  unless a ransom is paid in virtual currency. • One Percent Leak: If the victim does not pay the ransom quickly, the OnePercent Group actors  threaten to release a portion of the stolen data to various clearnet websites. • Full Leak: If the ransom is not paid in full after the “one percent leak”, OnePercent Group actors  threaten to sell the stolen data to the Sodinokibi Group2  to publish at an auction. The actors will persistently demand to speak with a victim company’s designated  negotiator or otherwise threaten to publish the stolen data. When a victim company does not respond,  the actors send subsequent threats to publish the victim company’s stolen data via the same ProtonMail  email address. The attachment’s macros infect the system  with the IcedID1 banking trojan. The zip file includes a Microsoft Word or Excel document that contains  malicious macros that allow the actors to subsequently infect the victim’s system with the banking Trojan  IcedID."

Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics,2021-07-19,3,"{'phishing': 5, 'ransomware': 5, 'threats_of_violence': 6, 'malware': 4}","Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to  Disrupt the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics     Summary  The FBI is warning entities associated with the Tokyo 2020 Summer  Olympics that cyber actors who wish to disrupt the event could use  distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, social  engineering, phishing campaigns, or insider threats to block or disrupt  live broadcasts of the event, steal and possibly hack and leak or hold  hostage sensitive data, or impact public or private digital  infrastructure supporting the Olympics. Adversaries could use social engineering and  phishing campaigns in the lead up to the event to obtain access or use previously obtained  access to implant malware to disrupt affected networks during the event. Social engineering  and phishing campaigns continue to provide adversaries with the access needed to carry out  such attacks. Prior to the event, the actors targeted South  Korean citizens and officials, Olympic athletes, partners, visitors, and International Olympic  Committee officials with spearphishing campaigns and malicious mobile applications. To help prevent targeted social engineering,  ransomware, and phishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of  potential cyber threats and how they are delivered. Cyber actors could use ransomware or other malicious tools and services available for purchase  on the Internet to execute DDoS attacks against Internet service providers and/or television  broadcast companies to interrupt service during the Olympics. Ransomware Best Practices  The FBI does not recommend paying ransoms.  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes  procedures for response and notification in a ransomware incident and plans for the  possibility of critical systems being inaccessible for a period of time. The FBI to  date is not aware of any specific cyber threat against these Olympics,  but encourages partners to remain vigilant and maintain best practices  in their network and digital environments. TLP: WHITE     TLP: WHITE  Threat Overview   Large, high-profile events provide an opportunity for criminal and nation-state cyber actors to  make money, sow confusion, increase their notoriety, discredit adversaries, and advance  ideological goals. The FBI also suggests reviewing or establishing security                                 TLP: WHITE     TLP: WHITE  policies, user agreements, and patching plans to address current threats posed by malicious  cyber actors. Ensure that employees are aware of  what to do and who to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyber- attack, to help quickly and efficiently identify threats and employ mitigation strategies. The  Russian actors obfuscated the true source of the malware by emulating code used by a North  Korean group, creating the potential for misattribution.  Automatically update antivirus and anti-malware solutions and conduct regular virus  and malware scans. Payment does not guarantee files will be  recovered and may embolden malicious cyber actors to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of malware, and/or may fund  illicit activities."

This FLASH has been released  TLP:WHITE    Conti Ransomware Attacks Impact Healthcare  and First Responder Networks  Summary  The FBI identified at least 16 Conti ransomware attacks targeting US  healthcare and first responder networks, including law enforcement  agencies, emergency medical services, 9-1-1 dispatch centers, and  municipalities within the last year. Like most ransomware variants, Conti typically steals victims’ files  and encrypts the servers and workstations in an effort to force a  ransom payment from the victim. Conti weaponizes Word  documents with embedded Powershell scripts, initially staging Cobalt Strike via the Word documents  and then dropping Emotet onto the network, giving the actor access to deploy ransomware. Actors  are observed inside the victim network between four days and three weeks on average before  deploying Conti ransomware, primarily using dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for delivery. Once Conti actors deploy the ransomware, they may stay in the network and  beacon out using Anchor DNS. The attackers can use TrickBot to also drop other malware,  including Conti ransomware. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It  may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors  to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.

Darkside Ransomware: Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks,2021-05-20,2,"{'phishing': 3, 'ransomware': 17, 'threats_of_violence': 5, 'malware': 3}","The Darkside group has publicly stated that they  prefer to target organizations that can afford to pay large ransoms instead of hospitals, schools, non- profits, and governments.[3],[4]  According to open-source reporting, Darkside actors have previously been observed gaining initial  access through phishing and exploiting remotely accessible accounts and systems and Virtual  Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) (Phishing [T1566], Exploit Public-Facing Application [T1190], External  Remote Services [T1133]).[5],[6] Darkside actors have also been observed using Remote Desktop  Protocol (RDP) to maintain Persistence [TA0003].[7]  After gaining access, Darkside actors deploy Darkside ransomware to encrypt and steal sensitive  data (Data Encrypted for Impact [T1486]). •  Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. •  Implement a user training program and simulated attacks for spearphishing to  discourage users from visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments and re- enforce the appropriate user responses to spearphishing emails. TLP: WHITE Product ID: AA21-131A May 11, 2021 TLP:WHITE  Darkside Ransomware: Best Practices for  Preventing Business Disruption from  Ransomware Attacks  SUMMARY  Callout Box: This advisory uses the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common  Knowledge (ATT&CK®) framework, version 9. The Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a critical infrastructure (CI) entity—a pipeline  company—in the United States. Malicious cyber actors deployed Darkside ransomware against the  pipeline company’s information technology (IT) network.[1] At this time, there is no indication that the  entity’s operational technology (OT) networks have been directly affected by the ransomware. These mitigations will help CI owners and operators improve their entity's  functional resilience by reducing their vulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business  degradation if impacted by ransomware. The Darkside group develops ransomware used by  cybercriminal actors and receives a share of the proceeds. The actors then threaten to publicly release the data if the  ransom is not paid.[8],[9] The Darkside ransomware uses Salsa20 and RSA encryption.[10]  Darkside actors primarily use The Onion Router (TOR) for Command and Control (C2) [TA0011]  (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy [1090.003]).[11],[12] The actors have also been observed using Cobalt Strike  for C2.[13]  MITIGATIONS  CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of  compromise by ransomware attacks. CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations now to reduce the risk  of severe business degradation should their CI entity fall victim to a ransomware attack in the future. Backups should be isolated from network connections  that could enable the spread of ransomware. It is important that backups be maintained  offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and encrypt or delete accessible  backups. Maintaining current backups offline is critical because if your network data is  encrypted with ransomware, your organization can restore systems to its previous state. (See the Software Engineering Institute’s  page on ransomware.)  o Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event they need  to be rebuilt. Implement software restriction policies (SRPs) or  other controls to prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,  such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers or  compression/decompression programs, including the AppData/LocalAppData folder. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, CISA and FBI recommend the following  actions:  •  Isolate the infected system. Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices  that shared a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware. Paying a ransom may  embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in  the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help CI organizations assess, identify and  reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced  threat actor tactics and techniques. The applications listed in the IOCs were leveraged by the threat actors during  the course of a compromise. In response to the cyberattack, the company  proactively disconnected certain OT systems to ensure the safety of the OT systems.[2] At this time,  there are no indications that the threat actor moved laterally to OT systems. •  Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using  up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network  assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware. If possible, scan  your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware."

Threat Overview  In February 2021, a US-based financial institution was notified of a  spear-phishing attempt which impersonated the financial institution’s  brand to target a renewable energy company. The phishing e-mail appeared to                                  TLP:WHITE    TLP:WHITE  originate from a United Kingdom–based financial institution, stating the US financial  institution’s loan to the victim was confirmed and could be accessed through an application  which appeared to  represent the US financial institution. The phishing e-mail included two  .pdf files, one of which spoofed the name and likeness of the UK’s National Crime Agency and  another which appeared to contain SWIFT information. The phishing e-mail also contained a  link to download the application and a username and password for access. As part of this spear-phishing campaign, the cyber actors also registered a fraudulent domain  impersonating the US financial institution. The below indicators were observed in conjunction with this spear-phishing campaign.

Well-maintained anti-virus  software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker tools delivered via  spear-phishing. Application control software limits users to  only execute applications and code allowed by the organization, rendering  malicious executables delivered via spear-phishing unable to execute. Users who browse the internet, use  email, and execute code with administrator privileges make spear-phishing much  more effective by enabling attackers to move laterally across a network, gain  additional accesses, and access highly sensitive information. TLP:WHITE    TLP:WHITE  Recommendations  • Ensure anti-virus and anti-malware software are enabled and signature  definitions are updated regularly in a timely manner."

The ransomware leaves a ransom note on  machines instructing the victim to communicate with the threat actors  via an online chat. TLP: WHITE    TLP: WHITE  Threat Overview    The FBI assesses Egregor ransomware is operating as a Ransomware as a Service Model. In this model,  multiple different individuals play a part in conducting a single intrusion and ransomware event. Egregor ransomware utilizes multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including targeting  business network and employee personal accounts that share access with business networks or devices. Once Egregor gains access to the network, Egregor ransomware affiliates use common pen testing and  exploit tools like Cobalt Strike, Qakbot/Qbot, Advanced IP Scanner, and AdFind to escalate privileges and  move laterally across a network, and tools like Rclone (sometimes renamed or hidden as svchost) and 7zip  to exfiltrate data. Paying a ransom emboldens adversaries to  target additional organizations, encourages other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of  ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to  report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office.

"Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Actors Compromise Federal Network, Deploy Crypto Miner, Credential Harvester",2022-11-21,4,"{'threats_of_violence': 21, 'malware': 5}","Product ID: AA22-320A November 16, 2022 TLP:CLEAR Co-Authored by:  Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Actors  Compromise Federal Network, Deploy Crypto  Miner, Credential Harvester  SUMMARY  From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a  Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced  persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that  cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server,  installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised  credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA and FBI encourage all organizations with affected VMware systems that did not immediately  apply available patches or workarounds to assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities. If  suspected initial access or compromise is detected based on IOCs or TTPs described in this CSA,  CISA and FBI encourage organizations to assume lateral movement by threat actors, investigate  connected systems (including the DC), and audit privileged accounts. For more information on Iranian government-sponsored Iranian malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s  Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage and FBI’s Iran Threats webpage. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations. Based on trusted third-party  reporting, 51.89.181[.]64 is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server associated with  threat actors exploiting Log4Shell. As trusted-third party reporting associated Log4Shell activity from  51.89.181[.]64 with lateral movement and targeting of DCs, CISA suspected the threat actors had  moved laterally and compromised the organization’s DC. The threat actors  also moved laterally to the domain controller, compromised credentials, and implanted Ngrok reverse  proxies. Threat Actor Activity  In February 2022, the threat actors exploited Log4Shell [T1190] for initial access [TA0001] to the  organization’s unpatched VMware Horizon server. Once the threat actor established themselves on the  VDI-KMS host, CISA observed the actors download around 30 megabytes of files from  transfer[.]sh server associated with 144.76.136[.]153. Ngrok is known to be used for malicious purposes.[1]    The threat actors then executed Mimikatz on VDI-KMS to harvest credentials and created a rogue  domain administrator account [T1136.002]. The threat actors were able to implant Ngrok on multiple hosts to  ensure Ngrok’s persistence should they lose access to a machine during a routine reboot. It is possible, but was not observed, that the threat actors configured a  custom domain, or used other Ngrok tunnel domains, wildcarded here as *.ngrok[.]com,  *.ngrok[.]io, ngrok.*.tunnel[.]com, or korgn.*.lennut[.]com. Additionally, the threat actor was observed attempting to dump the Local Security Authority  Subsystem Service (LSASS) process [T1003.001] with task manager but this was stopped by  additional anti-virus the FCEB organization had installed. MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES  See table 1 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory, as well as  corresponding detection and/or mitigation recommendations. Table 1: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise  Initial Access  Technique Title  ID  Use  Recommendations  Exploit Public- Facing Application  T1190  The actors exploited  Log4Shell for initial  access to the  organization’s VMware  Horizon server. INCIDENT RESPONSE   If suspected initial access or compromise is detected based on IOCs or TTPs in this CSA, CISA  encourages organizations to assume lateral movement by threat actors and investigate connected  systems and the DC. MITIGATIONS  CISA and FBI recommend implementing the mitigations below and in table 1 to improve your  organization's cybersecurity posture on the basis of threat actor behaviors. Malicious  activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ TGS and can be used to  obtain hashed credentials that threat actors attempt to crack. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS    In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and FBI recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. Mitigation: Employ anti-malware to  automatically detect and quarantine  malicious scripts [M1049]. Create Account:  Local Account  T1136.001  The actors’ malware  can create local user  accounts.

Victims of  ransomware operations should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA. Hive     Actions to Take Today to Mitigate         Cyber Threats from Ransomware:    Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. From June 2021  through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of  businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications,  Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH). Prior to encryption, Hive ransomware removes virus definitions and disables all portions of Windows  Defender and other common antivirus programs in the system registry [T1112]. In addition to its capabilities against the Microsoft Windows operating system, Hive  ransomware has known variants for Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD. Hive actors have been known to reinfect—with either Hive ransomware or another ransomware  variant—the networks of victim organizations who have restored their network without making a  ransom payment. Indicators of Compromise  Threat actors have leveraged the following IOCs during Hive ransomware compromises. MITIGATIONS  FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend organizations, particularly in the HPH sector, implement the  following to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and  to reduce the risk of compromise by Hive ransomware:  •  Verify Hive actors no longer have access to the network. o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing  & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways  to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. Government’s official one-stop location for resources  to tackle ransomware more effectively. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the  following actions. Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices  that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware. In addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to  prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. Protective Controls and Architecture  •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. Paying a ransom may  embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in  the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Doing so provides  investigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them  accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. Note: Some  of these indicators are legitimate applications that Hive threat actors used to aid in further malicious  exploitation. See tables 2−3 below for IOCs obtained from FBI threat response  investigations as recently as November 2022. •  Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login credentials  and change passwords/settings if applicable. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.

TLP: WHITE Product ID: AA22-294A October 21, 2022 TLP:WHITE Co-Authored by:  #StopRansomware: Daixin Team  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to  publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware  threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations  protect against ransomware. Cybercrime actors routinely target HPH Sector organizations with ransomware:  •  As of October 2022, per FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) data, specifically victim  reports across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the HPH Sector accounts for 25 percent of  ransomware complaints. Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware as  soon as they are released. Since then, Daixin Team  cybercrime actors have caused ransomware incidents at multiple HPH Sector organizations where  they have:  •  Deployed ransomware to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including  electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet  services, and/or  •  Exfiltrated personal identifiable information (PII) and patient health information (PHI) and  threatened to release the information if a ransom is not paid. The actors have then used SSH to  connect to accessible ESXi servers and deploy ransomware [T1486] on those servers. According to third-party reporting, the Daixin Team’s ransomware is based on leaked Babuk Locker  source code. This third-party reporting as well as FBI analysis show that the ransomware targets  ESXi servers and encrypts files located in /vmfs/volumes/ with the following extensions: .vmdk,  .vmem, .vswp, .vmsd, .vmx, and .vmsn. Preparing for Ransomware  •  Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and  restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least  minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident and protect against data losses. •  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated  communications plan that includes response procedures for a ransomware incident. Mitigating and Preventing Ransomware  •  Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that  are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Responding to Ransomware Incidents  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:  •  Follow your organization’s Ransomware Response Checklist (see Preparing for Ransomware  section). Note: FBI, CISA, and HHS strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files  and records will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment.

The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Zeppelin ransomware is a derivative of the Delphi-based Vega malware family and functions as a  Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying Zeppelin  ransomware, actors spend one to two weeks mapping or enumerating the victim network to identify  data enclaves, including cloud storage and network backups [TA0007]. Zeppelin actors can deploy  Zeppelin ransomware as a .dll or .exe file or contained within a PowerShell loader. Once the ransomware is executed, a randomized  nine-digit hexadecimal number is appended to each encrypted file as a file extension, e.g.,  file.txt.txt.C59-E0C-929 [T1486]. DETECTION   Click the attachment in this .pdf for the YARA signature: YARA Signature  MITIGATIONS  The FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit  potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  risk of compromise by Zeppelin ransomware:   Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, the cloud).   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.   No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment.

This joint CSA provides information—including tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and  indicators of compromise (IOCs)—on Maui ransomware obtained from FBI incident response  activities and industry analysis of a Maui sample. The FBI, CISA, and Treasury urge HPH Sector  organizations as well as other critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from ransomware operations. Victims of Maui ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA. The FBI, CISA, and Treasury highly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files  and records will be recovered and may pose sanctions risks. Note: in September 2021, Treasury  issued an updated advisory highlighting the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments  and the proactive steps companies can take to mitigate such risks. entities to adopt and improve cybersecurity practices and report ransomware  attacks to, and fully cooperate with, law enforcement. The updated advisory states that when affected  parties take these proactive steps, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would be  more likely to resolve apparent sanctions violations involving ransomware attacks with a non-public  enforcement response. TECHNICAL DETAILS  Since May 2021, the FBI has observed and responded to multiple Maui ransomware incidents at HPH  Sector organizations. North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these  incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records  services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services. Maui Ransomware  Maui ransomware (maui.exe) is an encryption binary. According to industry analysis of a sample of  Maui (SHA256: 5b7ecf7e9d0715f1122baf4ce745c5fcd769dee48150616753fec4d6da16e99e)— provided in Stairwell Threat Report: Maui Ransomware—the ransomware appears to be designed for  manual execution [TA0002] by a remote actor. See Stairwell Threat Report: Maui Ransomware for additional information on Maui ransomware,  including YARA rules and a key extractor. In addition, the FBI, CISA, and Treasury urge all organizations, including HPH Sector organizations,  to apply the following recommendations to prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware  incidents.

Ransomware Attacks Straining Local US Governments and Public Services,2022-03-30,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'extortion': 1, 'ransomware': 21, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 2}","Ransomware tactics have and will continue to evolve as noted in the February 2022 Joint  Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) by government agencies in the United States, Australia, and the United   TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE  Kingdom.1 The top three initial infection vectors in 2021 were phishing emails, remote desktop  protocol exploitation, and software vulnerability exploitation.  Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among  users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and  opening suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing  and spearphishing emails. In 2021, actors expanded their targeting tactics and widened the  scope of victimization potential by implementing service-for-hire business models, sharing victim  information among actor groups, diversifying extortion strategies, and attacking upstream/  downstream accesses and data sources such as cloud infrastructure, managed service providers,  and software supply chains. Ransomware attacks against local government  entities and the subsequent impacts are especially significant due to the public’s dependency on  critical utilities, emergency services, educational facilities, and other services overseen by local  governments, making them attractive targets for cyber criminals. “The State of Ransomware in Government 2021” survey of 30 countries, conducted through an   TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE  independent research group commissioned by a UK-based company, found rectifying a ransomware  attack on a local government often included financial liabilities related to operational downtime,  people time, device costs, network costs, lost opportunity, and, in some cases, paid ransoms. According to a US-based media source reporting on state and local  government matters, underfunded public sector organizations’ understaffed and outdated systems  often put them in the position to pay ransoms simply to get the data back. Recent reporting indicates ransomware incidents against local governments resulted in  disruptions to public and health services, emergency and safety operations, and the  compromise of personal data.  In January 2022, a US county took computer systems offline, closed public offices, and ran  emergency response operations using “backup contingencies” after a ransomware attack  impacted local government operations.  In September 2021, cyber actors infected a US county network with ransomware, resulting  in the closure of the county courthouse and the theft of a substantial amount of county data  (to include personal information on residents, employees, and vendors).  In May 2021, cyber actors infected local US county government systems with PayOrGrief  ransomware, making some servers inaccessible and limiting operations.  In January 2021, cyber actors infected local US county government systems with  ransomware that compromised jail and courthouse computers in addition to election,  assessment, financial, zoning, law enforcement, jail management, dispatch, and other files. The  ransomware note stated files would be deleted after two weeks if the ransom was not paid. In the next year, local US government agencies almost certainly will continue to experience  ransomware attacks, particularly as malware deployment and targeting tactics evolve, further  endangering public health and safety, and resulting in significant financial liabilities. Recommendations  The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage  other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by  identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law,  when possible. The FBI encourages local government agencies to proactively initiate contingency planning, to  the degree possible, for operational continuity in the event of a ransomware attack and  systems are inaccessible. The security modules may prevent the operating system from  making arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against  ransomware, as well as against remote code execution (RCE). Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware  by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by  restricting adversary lateral movement. Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)  can prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat  actors from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, use tools that log and report all network traffic, including lateral  movement on a network. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems  (NIDS) are also able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with  early stages of ransomware deployment. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. Threat  In 2021, local US government agency victims were primarily among smaller counties and  municipalities, which was likely indicative of their cybersecurity resource and budget limitations. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations. If threat actors are not  able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving  laterally. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting  where accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential  protection features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for  lateral movement and privilege escalation."

Threat  In June and again in August 2017, TRITON malware (also known as TRISIS and HatMan) was  used against a Middle East–based petrochemical facility’s safety controllers. Resources:   CISA Joint CSA Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to  U.S. TRITON was malware designed to cause physical safety systems to cease operating or to  operate in an unsafe manner. TRITON malware targeted the Schneider Electric Triconex safety instrumented system (SIS),  which is used to initiate safe shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. TRITON  malware affected Triconex Tricon safety controllers by modifying in-memory firmware to add  additional programming, potentially leading to damage of a facility, system downtime, and  even loss of life should the SIS fail to initiate safe shutdown procedures. The US  Government has publicly attributed TRITON malware to TsNIIKhM, a Russian government- controlled research institution that supports the Russian armed forces with advanced research,  weapons, and cyber capabilities. TRITON malware was designed to target a specific SIS controller model, with a specific firmware  version, running a small range of specific versioned firmware, and used in critical infrastructure  facilities to initiate immediate shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. For more  information on affected equipment and TRITON malware, see CISA ICS Advisory Schneider  Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B) and CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR) HatMan - Safety  System Targeted Malware (Update B). In the 2017 attack, the actor gained initial access and then moved laterally through the  information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks onto the safety system  and installed TRITON malware. The facility automatically  entered a safe state after several of the Triconex ICS safety controllers detected an anomaly,  caused by software bugs in the TRITON malware. The subsequent investigation of the shutdown  revealed the attacker’s presence and the malware itself. The facility’s automatic shutdown and  detection of malware prevented the cyberattack from reaching its full capabilities. TRITON malware’s design gave the attackers complete remote control of the SIS, providing  them the capability to cause significant physical damage and loss of life if the plant were to  enter an unsafe state, according to investigations and analysis that followed the event. Russian cyber actors have previously conspired to deploy malware and take other disruptive  actions for the strategic benefit of Russia through unauthorized access to victim computers and  ICS. These cyberattacks used some of the world’s most destructive malware to date, including     TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE KillDisk and Industroyer, which each caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016,  respectively. Russian cyber actors have also deployed non-disruptive malware, such as Havex,  which enables the actors to return to compromised and otherwise vulnerable ICS devices for  future espionage purposes. For additional information on the TRITON malware attack, see the FBI PIN titled Unattributed  Cyber Actors Exploiting Internet-connected ICS/SCADA Systems, PIN 20180614-001.

RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise,2022-03-07,1,"{'ransomware': 10, 'threats_of_violence': 3, 'malware': 1}","TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  7 MARCH 2022  CU-000163-MW  RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise     Summary  The FBI first became aware of RagnarLocker in April 2020 and subsequently produced a FLASH  to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) at that time. As of January 2022, the FBI has  identified at least 52 entities across 10 critical infrastructure sectors affected by RagnarLocker  ransomware, including entities in the critical manufacturing, energy, financial services,  government, and information technology sectors. RagnarLocker ransomware actors work as  part of a ransomware family1, frequently changing obfuscation techniques to avoid detection  and prevention. 1 Ransomware family is a group of binaries associated to several ransomware variants or actor groups. The ransomware assigns a  drive letter to any volumes not assigned a logical drive letter and makes them accessible. Paying a ransom may embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the  ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so  provides investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware  attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations  assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats.  Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login  credentials and change passwords and settings. Taking this approach allows  the computer to continue to operate “normally” while the malware encrypts files with known  and unknown extensions containing data of value to the victim."

New Sandworm malware Cyclops Blink replaces VPNFilter,2022-02-23,1,"{'phishing': 2, 'botnet': 1, 'malware': 14}","Tell staff how to report suspected  phishing emails, and ensure they feel confident to do so. Never punish users for clicking phishing links or opening  attachments. In May 2018 Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter, and the US  Department of Justice linked the activity2 to Sandworm and announced its disruption  of the botnet. New Sandworm malware  Cyclops Blink replaces  VPNFilter       Version 1.0      23 February 2022  © Crown Copyright 2022               New Sandworm malware Cyclops Blink  replaces VPNFilter   The Sandworm actor, which the UK and US have previously attributed to  the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new  more advanced framework. Background   The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) in the US have identified that the actor known as Sandworm or  Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink. The malicious cyber activity below has  previously been attributed to Sandworm:    • The BlackEnergy disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015  • Industroyer in 2016  • NotPetya in 2017  • Attacks against the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 20181  • A series of disruptive attacks against Georgia in 20192    Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware  exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office  (SOHO) routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is also  available and can be read in parallel. It also provides mitigation measures to help organisations that may be affected by this  malware. VPNFilter   The malware was first exposed in 2018  A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 20181 describes VPNFilter and its  modules in detail. Cyclops Blink  Active since 2019  The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a  large-scale modular malware framework which is affecting network devices. The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices,1 but it  is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other  architectures and firmware. Malware overview   The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon  (T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded  and executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is  running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required. The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides  more detail about the malware. Affected organisations should therefore take steps to remove the malware. Indicators of compromise  Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis report for indicators  of compromise which may help detect this activity. Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory and to refer  to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink malware analysis  report to detect possible activity on networks."
Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Target Cleared Defense Contractor Networks to Obtain Sensitive U.S. Defense Information and Technology,2022-02-17,1,"{'phishing': 7, 'threats_of_violence': 36, 'malware': 3}","Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain  access to target networks, including spearphishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray  techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security. Initial Access   Russian state-sponsored cyber actors use brute force methods, spearphishing, harvested credentials,  and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to CDC networks. •  Threat actors send spearphishing emails with links to malicious domains [T1566.002] and use  publicly available URL shortening services to mask the link [T1027]. Initial Access [TA0001]  External Remote Services  [T1133]  Threat actors continue to research  vulnerabilities in Fortinet’s FortiGate  VPN devices, conducting brute force  attacks and leveraging CVE-2018-13379  to gain credentials to access victim  networks.2  Initial Access [TA0001]  Privilege Escalation  [TA0004]    Valid Accounts [T1078]  Exploit Public-Facing  Application [T1190]  Threat actors used credentials in  conjunction with known vulnerabilities on  public-facing applications, such as  virtual private networks (VPNs)—CVE- 2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—to  escalate privileges and gain remote  code execution (RCE) on the exposed  applications.3  Initial Access [TA0001]  Defense Evasion  [TA0005]  Phishing: Spearphishing  Link [T1566.002]  Obfuscated Files or  Information [T1027]  Threat actors sent spearphishing emails  using publicly available URL shortening  services.

For additional information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, see CISA's webpage, Russia  Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories. THREAT DETAILS  Targeted Industries and Assessed Motive  Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. For example, during a compromise in 2021, threat actors exfiltrated hundreds of documents  related to the company’s products, relationships with other countries, and internal personnel and legal  matters. Through these intrusions, the threat actors have acquired unclassified CDC-proprietary and export- controlled information. Exfiltrated Information  Threat Actor Activity  Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See the ATT&CK for  Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. See the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures  (TTPs) section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. •  Threat actors use brute force techniques [T1110] to identify valid account credentials  [T1589.001] for domain and M365 accounts. •  The threat actors use harvested credentials in conjunction with known vulnerabilities—for  example, CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—on public-facing applications [T1078,  T1190], such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to escalate privileges and gain remote code  execution (RCE) on the exposed applications.1 In addition, threat actors have exploited CVE- 2018-13379 on FortiClient to obtain credentials to access networks. Credential Access   After gaining access to networks, the threat actors map the Active Directory (AD) and connect to  domain controllers, from which they exfiltrate credentials and export copies of the AD database  ntds.dit [T1003.003]. In multiple instances, the threat actors have used Mimikatz to dump admin  credentials from the domain controllers. Collection   Using compromised M365 credentials, including global admin accounts, the threat actors can gain  access to M365 resources, including SharePoint pages [T1213.002], user profiles, and user emails  [T1114.002]. Command and Control   The threat actors routinely use virtual private servers (VPSs) as an encrypted proxy. Persistence   In multiple instances, the threat actors maintained persistent access for at least six months. In these cases, it  is likely the threat actors relied on possession of legitimate credentials for persistence [T1078],  enabling them to pivot to other accounts, as needed, to maintain access to the compromised  environments. Initial Access [TA0001]  Credential Access  [TA0006]    OS Credential Dumping:  NTDS [T1003.003]  Valid Accounts: Domain  Accounts [T1078.002]  Threat actors logged into a victim’s VPN  server and connected to the domain  controllers, from which they exfiltrated  credentials and exported copies of the  AD database ntds.dit. Initial Access [TA0001]    Collection [TA0009]  Valid Accounts: Domain  Accounts [T1078.002]  Email Collection [T1114]  In one case, the threat actors used  legitimate credentials to exfiltrate emails  from the victim's enterprise email  system. Persistence [TA0003]  Lateral Movement  [TA0008]  Valid Accounts [T1078]  Threat actors used valid accounts for  persistence. Discovery [TA0007]  File and Network  Discovery [T1083]  After gaining access to networks, the  threat actors used BloodHound to map  the Active Directory. Discovery [TA0007]  Domain Trust Discovery  [T1482]  Threat actors gathered information on  domain trust relationships that were  used to identify lateral movement  opportunities. Command and Control  [TA0011]  Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy  [T1090.003]  Threat actors used multiple disparate  nodes, such as VPSs, to route traffic to  the target. Without a centralized log collection and monitoring capability, organizations have limited  ability to investigate incidents or detect the threat actor behavior described in this advisory. Note: For guidance on using these  and other detection tools, refer to CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Detecting Post-Compromise  Threat Activity in Microsoft Cloud Environments. Note: For guidance on evicting advanced persistent threat (APT) actors from cloud and enterprise  environments, refer to CISA Analysis Report Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and  Active Directory/Microsoft 365 (M365) Compromise. MITIGATIONS  The FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage all CDCs, with or without evidence of compromise, to apply the  following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by this threat actor. Threat actors often use PowerShell to hide their  malicious activities.14  •  Update PowerShell instances to version 5.0 or later and uninstall all earlier versions of  PowerShell. o Subscribe to CISA cybersecurity notifications and advisories to keep up with  known exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. •  Sign up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce  exposure to threats. These tools allow a high degree of  visibility into the security status of endpoints and can be an effective defense against threat  actors. Maintain Rigorous Configuration Management Programs    •  Audit configuration management programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging  threats. Having  a robust configuration program hinders sophisticated threat operations by limiting the  effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.16  Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege  •  Apply the principle of least privilege. Threat actors are known to exploit trust  relationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and  data. •  Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see  suspicious activity or suspect a cyber intrusion to help quickly and efficiently identify  threats and employ mitigation strategies. The actors often maintain persistence by using legitimate credentials and a variety of  malware when exfiltrating emails and data. Although  the actors have used a variety of malware to maintain persistence, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have also  observed intrusions that did not rely on malware or other persistence mechanisms. Employ Antivirus Programs   •  Ensure that antivirus applications are installed on all organizations’ computers and are  configured to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the operating system security  baseline."

2021 Trends Show Increased Globalized Threat of Ransomware,2022-02-09,1,"{'phishing': 5, 'extortion': 2, 'ransomware': 48, 'threats_of_violence': 27, 'malware': 2}","•  Implement user training and phishing  exercises to raise awareness about the  risks of suspicious links and  attachments. TECHNICAL DETAILS  Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom observed the  following behaviors and trends among cyber criminals in 2021:  •  Gaining access to networks via phishing, stolen Remote Desktop Protocols (RDP)  credentials or brute force, and exploiting vulnerabilities. Phishing emails, RDP  exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top three initial infection  vectors for ransomware incidents in 2021. •  Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among  users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening  suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and  spearphishing emails. After encrypting victim networks, ransomware  threat actors increasingly used “triple extortion” by threatening to (1) publicly release stolen  sensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim’s internet access, and/or (3) inform the victim’s  partners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident. The ACSC continued to observe  “double extortion” incidents in which a threat actor uses a combination of encryption and data  theft to pressure victims to pay ransom demands. TLP: WHITE   TLP:WHITE Co-Authored by:  Product ID: AA22-040A February 9, 2022 2021 Trends Show Increased Globalized Threat  of Ransomware   SUMMARY  In 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United  States,[1][2][3] Australia,[4] and the United  Kingdom[5] observed an increase in sophisticated,  high-impact ransomware incidents against critical  infrastructure organizations globally. The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  National Security Agency (NSA) observed incidents  involving ransomware against 14 of the 16 U.S. The Australian Cyber Security  Centre (ACSC) observed continued ransomware  targeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities,  including in the Healthcare and Medical, Financial Services and Markets, Higher Education and  Research, and Energy Sectors. The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  recognizes ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the United Kingdom. Education is one of  the top UK sectors targeted by ransomware actors, but the NCSC-UK has also seen attacks targeting  businesses, charities, the legal profession, and public services in the Local Government and Health  Sectors. Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to  Protect Against Ransomware:  •  Update your operating system and  software. This joint Cybersecurity Advisory—authored by cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom—provides observed behaviors and trends as well as mitigation  recommendations to help network defenders reduce their risk of compromise by ransomware. Once a ransomware threat actor has gained code  execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. The market for ransomware became increasingly  “professional” in 2021, and the criminal business model of ransomware is now well  established. In addition to their increased use of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS),  ransomware threat actors employed independent services to negotiate payments, assist  victims with making payments, and arbitrate payment disputes between themselves and other  cyber criminals. NCSC-UK observed that some ransomware threat actors offered their victims  the services of a 24/7 help center to expedite ransom payment and restoration of encrypted  systems or data. Note: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom assess  that if the ransomware criminal business model continues to yield financial returns for  ransomware actors, ransomware incidents will become more frequent. Every time a ransom is  paid, it confirms the viability and financial attractiveness of the ransomware criminal business  model. Eurasian ransomware groups have shared victim information  with each other, diversifying the threat to targeted organizations. For example, after  announcing its shutdown, the BlackMatter ransomware group transferred its existing victims to  infrastructure owned by another group, known as Lockbit 2.0. o In the first half of 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and Australia  observed ransomware threat actors targeting “big game” organizations—i.e., perceived  high-value organizations and/or those that provide critical services—in several high- profile incidents. However, ransomware groups suffered disruptions from U.S. Subsequently, the FBI observed some ransomware threat  actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from “big-game” and toward mid-sized  victims to reduce scrutiny. o The ACSC observed ransomware continuing to target Australian organizations of all  sizes, including critical services and “big game,” throughout 2021. Ransomware groups have increased their impact by:  •  Targeting the cloud. Ransomware developers targeted cloud infrastructures to exploit known  vulnerabilities in cloud applications, virtual machine software, and virtual machine  orchestration software. Ransomware threat actors also targeted cloud accounts, cloud  application programming interfaces (APIs), and data backup and storage systems to deny  access to cloud resources and encrypt data. Ransomware threat actors  have also targeted cloud service providers to encrypt large amounts of customer data. Ransomware threat actors have targeted managed  service providers (MSPs). By compromising an MSP, a ransomware threat actor could access multiple  victims through one initial compromise. Cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom assess there will be an increase in ransomware incidents  where threat actors target MSPs to reach their clients. Globally, in 2021, ransomware threat actors targeted  software supply chain entities to subsequently compromise and extort their customers. Targeting software supply chains allows ransomware threat actors to increase the scale of  their attacks by accessing multiple victims through a single initial compromise. Ransomware threat actors may view holidays and weekends— when offices are normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network  defenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. For more information, see joint  FBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory, Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends. MITIGATIONS  Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend  network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware  incidents:  •  Keep all operating systems and software up to date. The security modules may prevent the operating system from making  arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as  against remote code execution (RCE). Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by  controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting  adversary lateral movement. For example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which  Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents  affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control). Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can  prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat actors  from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, leverage a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement on a network. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also  able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of  ransomware deployment. Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology  networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices  for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more recommendations, including  mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall  victim to ransomware. RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend organizations:  •  Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information  Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Criminal activity is motivated by financial gain, so  paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations (or re-target the same  organization) or encourage cyber criminals to engage in the distribution of ransomware. Additionally, reducing the  financial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the ransomware criminal business model. While it continues to prove challenging, the  NCSC-UK has supported UK Government efforts by identifying needed policy changes—including  measures about the cyber insurance industry and ransom payments—that could reduce the threat of  ransomware. whole-of-government webpage providing  ransomware resources and alerts. •  CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. In addition to exploiting weaknesses to gain  direct access, threat actors sometimes reach cloud storage systems by compromising local  (on-premises) devices and moving laterally to the cloud systems. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting where  accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential protection  features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement  and privilege escalation. If threat actors are not able to run  these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free  of malware."
Indicators of Compromise Associated with LockBit 2.0 Ransomware,2022-02-04,1,"{'ransomware': 13, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 3}","TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  4 February 2022 CU-000162-MW Indicators of Compromise Associated with LockBit 2.0  Ransomware    Summary  LockBit 2.0 operates as an affiliate-based Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and employs a wide  variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense  and mitigation. LockBit 2.0 ransomware compromises victim networks through a variety of  techniques, including, but not limited to, purchased access, unpatched vulnerabilities, insider  access, and zero day exploits. Technical Details  LockBit 2.0 is best described as a heavily obfuscated ransomware application leveraging bitwise  operations to decode strings and load required modules to evade detection. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future       TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under  US law. Recommended Mitigations:  FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of  compromise by LockBit 2.0 ransomware:   Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and  domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment, limit  common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions:   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can  help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and  access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations  assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. The threat actors then use both publicly available and custom  tools to exfiltrate data followed by encryption using the Lockbit malware. The ransom note also threatens to leak  exfiltrated victim data on the LockBit 2.0 leak site and demands a ransom to avoid these  actions. While some of these  applications and services can support legitimate purposes, they can also be used by threat  actors to aid in system compromise or exploration of an enterprise. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective  steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. If  threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating  privileges and/or moving laterally. LockBit 2.0 also developed a  Linux-based malware which takes advantage of vulnerabilities within VMWare ESXi virtual  machines. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE    Indicators  The indicators of compromise (IOCs) and malware characteristics outlined below were derived  from field analysis and the following samples are as of February 2022."
Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics,2022-01-31,1,"{'phishing': 5, 'ransomware': 5, 'threats_of_violence': 8, 'malware': 8}","These  activities include distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering,  data theft or leaks, phishing campaigns, disinformation campaigns, or insider threats, and when  successful, can block or disrupt the live broadcast of the event, steal or leak sensitive data, or impact  public or private digital infrastructure supporting the Olympics. Adversaries could use social  engineering and phishing campaigns leading up to and during the event to implant malware to disrupt  networks broadcasting the event. While there were no major cyber disruptions, the most popular attack methods used  were malware, email spoofing, phishing and the use of fake websites and streaming services designed to  look like official Olympic service providers. During the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, Russian cyber actors conducted a destructive cyber  attack against the opening ceremony, enabled through spearphishing campaigns and malicious mobile  applications. To help prevent targeted social engineering,  ransomware, and phishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential  cyber threats and how they are delivered. Cyber actors could use ransomware or other malicious tools and  services available for purchase to execute DDoS attacks against Internet service providers and television  broadcast companies to interrupt service during the Olympics. Ransomware Best Practices   The FBI does not recommend paying ransoms. • Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes procedures for  response and notification in a ransomware incident and plans for the possibility of critical systems  being inaccessible for a period of time.

Additionally, the FBI warns Olympic  participants and travelers of potential threats associated with mobile applications developed by  untrusted vendors. The FBI to date is not aware of any specific cyber  threat against the Olympics, but encourages partners to remain vigilant and maintain best practices in  their network and digital environments. Threat  As we mentioned in PIN 20210719-001, large, high-profile events provide an opportunity for criminal  and nation-state cyber actors to make money, sow confusion, increase their notoriety, discredit  adversaries, and advance ideological goals. The FBI also suggests  reviewing or establishing security policies, user agreements, and patching plans to address current  threats posed by malicious cyber actors. Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and  who to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyberattack, to help quickly and efficiently  identify threats and employ mitigation strategies. The download and use of applications, including those required to participate or stay  in country, could increase the opportunity for cyber actors to steal personal information or install  tracking tools, malicious code, or malware1.

Russian FSB cyber actor Star  Blizzard continues worldwide  spear-phishing campaigns  The Russia-based actor is targeting organisations and  individuals in the UK and other geographical areas of  interest Overview  The Russia-based actor Star Blizzard (formerly known as SEABORGIUM, also  known as Callisto Group/TA446/COLDRIVER/TAG-53/BlueCharlie) continues  to successfully use spear-phishing attacks against targeted organisations  and individuals in the UK, and other geographical areas of interest, for  information-gathering activity. This advisory raises awareness of the spear-phishing techniques Star  Blizzard uses to target individuals and organisations. Outline of the attacks  The activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets  a specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to  the targets. In a spear-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target  to have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to  another target, or both. Preference for personal email addresses  Star Blizzard has predominantly sent spear-phishing emails to targets’  personal email addresses, although they have also used targets’ corporate  or business email addresses. Delivery of malicious link  Once trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and  shares a link [T1566.002], apparently to a document or website of interest. They have also used compromised email accounts for further  phishing activity [T1586.002]. Conclusion  Spear-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star  Blizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their  success. In the UK you can report related suspicious activity to the NCSC  Information on effective defence against spear-phishing is included in the  ‘Mitigation’ section below. Resource  Development  T1585.0 02  Establish Accounts: Email  Accounts  Star Blizzard registers consumer  email accounts matching the names  of individuals they are impersonating  to conduct spear-phishing activity. Resource  Development  T1583.0 01  Acquire Infrastructure:  Domains  Star Blizzard registers domains to  host their phishing framework. Tactic  ID  Technique  Procedure  Resource  Development  T1586.0 02  Compromise Accounts:  Email Accounts  Star Blizzard has been observed  using compromised victim email  accounts to conduct spear-phishing  activity against contacts of the  original victim. Initial Access  T1566.0 01  Phishing: Spear-phishing  Attachment  Star Blizzard uses malicious links  embedded in email attachments to  direct victims to their credential- stealing sites. Initial Access  T1566.0 02  Phishing: Spear-phishing  Link  Star Blizzard sends spear-phishing  emails with malicious links directly to  credential-stealing sites, or to  documents hosted on a file-sharing  site, which then direct victims to  credential-stealing sites. Spear-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed  Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog1, but this is not  exhaustive."

Guidelines for secure AI system development,2023-11-28,4,{'threats_of_violence': 16},"AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside standard  cyber security threats. It  covers understanding risks and threat modelling, as well as specific topics and trade-offs to consider on  system and model design. Secure deployment    This section contains guidelines that apply to the deployment stage of the AI system development  life cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing  incident management processes, and responsible release. However, AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside  standard cyber security threats. The level of sophistication  and the methods of attack will vary depending on the adversary targeting the AI system, so the guidelines  should be considered alongside your organisation’s use cases and threat profile. Raise staff awareness of threats and risks System owners and senior leaders understand threats to secure AI and their mitigations. Your data  scientists and developers maintain an awareness of relevant security threats and failure modes and  help risk owners to make informed decisions. You consider your threat model  and associated security mitigations alongside functionality, user experience, deployment environment,  performance, assurance, oversight, ethical and legal requirements, among other considerations. This process involves  assessing the impact of AI-specific threats8 and documenting your decision making. Your assessment should consider that some threats may grow as AI systems  increasingly become viewed as high value targets, and as AI itself enables new, automated attack  vectors. Your decisions are  informed by your threat model, and are regularly reassessed as AI security research advances and  understanding of the threat evolves. 13 Guidelines for secure AI system development  14 This section contains guidelines that apply to the deployment stage of the AI system development life  cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing incident  management processes, and responsible release. Your approach to confidentiality risk mitigation will depend considerably on the use case and the threat  model. When configuration is necessary, the default option should  be broadly secure against common threats (that is, secure by default).

#StopRansomware: LockBit 3.0 Ransomware Affiliates Exploit CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed Vulnerability,2023-11-21,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'ransomware': 10, 'threats_of_violence': 11, 'malware': 3}","o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). Product ID: AA23-325A November 21, 2023 Authored by:    TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR #StopRansomware: LockBit 3.0 Ransomware  Affiliates Exploit CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed  Vulnerability  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to  publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware  threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations  protect against ransomware. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and Australian Signals Directorate’s  Australian Cyber Security Center (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)  to disseminate IOCs, TTPs, and detection methods associated with LockBit 3.0 ransomware  exploiting CVE-2023-4966, labeled Citrix Bleed, affecting Citrix NetScaler web application delivery  control (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway appliances. Observed TTPs for LockBit ransomware attacks can vary significantly in observed TTPs. This vulnerability provides  threat actors, including LockBit 3.0 ransomware affiliates, the capability to bypass MFA [T1556.006]  and hijack legitimate user sessions [T1563]. Other observed activities include the use of a variety of TTPs commonly associated with ransomware  activity. For example, LockBit 3.0 affiliates have been observed using AnyDesk and Splashtop remote  management and monitoring (RMM), Batch and PowerShell scripts, the execution of HTA files using  the Windows native utility mshta.exe and other common software tools typically associated with  ransomware incidents. •  The Joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices  as well as a ransomware response checklist. •  Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment provide no-cost cyber  hygiene and ransomware readiness assessment services. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Threat Actor Activity  Malware identified in this campaign is generated beginning with the execution of a PowerShell script  (123.ps1) which concatenates two base64 strings together, converts them to bytes, and writes them  to the designated file path. Table 6: ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise: Discovery  Technique Title  ID  Use  System Information  Discovery  T1082  Threat actors will attempt to obtain information  about the operating system and hardware,  including versions, and patches. Steal Web Session  Cookie  T1539  Threat actors with access to valid cookies can  establish an authenticated session within the  NetScaler appliance without a username,  password, or access to multifactor authentication  (MFA) tokens. ▪  Note: Removing malicious administrator accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering  threat actors may have established additional persistence mechanisms. CISA and NIST based  the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks  and guidance to protect against the most common  and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and  procedures. CISA and authoring  organizations recommend that software  manufacturers incorporate secure-by-design  and -default principles and tactics into their  software development practices to limit the  impact of exploitation such as threat actors  leveraging unpatched vulnerabilities within Citrix  NetScaler appliances, which strengthens the  security posture of their customers. o PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction  and possible TTPs of a threat actor’s PowerShell use. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. Once the file path is returned, the malware loads the  accompanying DLL file called a.dll into the running LSASS process. If the DLL is correctly loaded,  then the malware outputs the message ""[*]success"" in the console."
Scattered Spider,2023-11-16,4,"{'phishing': 11, 'extortion': 5, 'ransomware': 10, 'threats_of_violence': 66, 'sim_swap': 2, 'malware': 4}","  Enable and enforce phishing- resistant multifactor  authentication (MFA). Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access  Scattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts  against a target using victim-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3  [T1583.001]. The threat actors then work to identify the personally  identifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing,  obtaining answers for those users’ security questions. Phishing for Information  T1598  Scattered Spider threat actors use phishing to  obtain login credentials, gaining access to a  victim’s network. Table 5: Resource Development  Technique Title  ID  Use  Acquire Infrastructure:  Domains  T1583.001  Scattered Spider threat actors create domains for  use in phishing and smishing attempts against  targeted organizations. Phishing (Mobile)  T1660  Scattered Spider threat actors send SMS  messages, known as smishing, when targeting a  victim. Phishing: Spearphishing Voice  T1566.004  Scattered Spider threat actors use voice  communications to convince IT help desk  personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens. These MFA implementations are resistant to phishing and not suspectable to push  bombing or SIM swap attacks, which are techniques known to be used by Scattered Spider  actors. See CISA’s fact sheet Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA for more information. If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example [CPG 2.W]: o Audit the network for systems using RDP. o Close unused RDP ports. o Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts. o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). o Log RDP login attempts. In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques,  and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:    Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, the cloud).   Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access  critical systems [CPG 2.H]. Scattered Spider threat actors, per trusted third parties, have typically engaged in data theft  for extortion and have also been known to utilize BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware alongside their usual  TTPs.   Monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by  ransomware and data theft [T1657]. Table 16: Exfiltration  Technique Title  ID  Use  Exfiltration  TA0010  Scattered Spider threat actors exfiltrate data from  a target network to for data extortion. Financial Theft  T1657  Scattered Spider threat actors monetized access  to victim networks in numerous ways including  extortion-enabled ransomware and data theft. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat  actors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks—thereby encrypting  VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. The FBI and CISA recommend  that software manufactures incorporate  secure-by-design and -default principles  and tactics into their software development  practices limiting the impact of ransomware  techniques, thus, strengthening the secure  posture for their customers.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including  lateral movement, on a network.

TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-320A November 16, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR Scattered Spider  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this  joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to recent  activity by Scattered Spider threat actors against the  commercial facilities sectors and subsectors. See the MITRE  ATT&CK® Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. According to public reporting,  Scattered Spider threat actors have [2],[3],[4]:    Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598],[T1656]. After gaining access to networks, FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly  available, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Scattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off  the land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently  modifying their TTPs. Recent Scattered Spider TTPs  New TTP - File Encryption  More recently, the FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after  exfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors  communicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII  [T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656]  to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens  [T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on  (SSO) environments. Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation  Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after  compromising a user’s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a  federated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking  [T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO  account attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider  and then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the  threat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords  are changed [T1078]. Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration  Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform  discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation  [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging  into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim’s Active  Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim’s code repositories [T1213.003], code- signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon  Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement  [TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider  threat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for  emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The  threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to  identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in  response to victim defenses. MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES  See Tables 4 through 17 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. Table 4: Reconnaissance  Technique Title  ID  Use  Gather Victim Identity  Information  T1589  Scattered Spider threat actors gather usernames,  passwords, and PII for targeted organizations.

Domain Policy Modification:  Domain Trust Modification  T1484.002  Scattered Spider threat actors add a federated  identify provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and  activate automatic account linking. Table 10: Defense Evasion  Technique Title  ID  Use  Modify Cloud Compute  Infrastructure: Create Cloud  Instance  T1578.002  Scattered Spider threat actors will create cloud  instances for use during lateral movement and  data collection. Impersonation  TA1656  Scattered Spider threat actors pose as company  IT and/or helpdesk staff to gain access to victim’s  networks. Scattered Spider threat actors use social  engineering to convince IT help desk personnel to  reset passwords and/or MFA tokens. Forge Web Credentials  T1606  Scattered Spider threat actors may forge MFA  tokens to gain access to a victim’s network. Unsecured Credentials:  Credentials in Files  T1552.001  Scattered Spider threat actors search for  insecurely stored credentials on victim’s systems. Unsecured Credentials:  Private Keys  T1552.004  Scattered Spider threat actors search for  insecurely stored private keys on victim’s systems. Table 12: Discovery  Technique Title  ID  Use  Discovery  TA0007  Upon gaining access to a targeted network,  Scattered Spider threat actors seek out  SharePoint sites, credential storage  documentation, VMware vCenter, infrastructure  backups and enumerate AD to identify useful  information to support further operations. Browser Information Discovery  T1217  Scattered Spider threat actors use tools (e.g.,  Raccoon Stealer) to obtain browser histories. Cloud Service Dashboard  T1538  Scattered Spider threat actors leverage AWS  Systems Manager Inventory to discover targets for  lateral movement. File and Directory Discovery  T1083  Scattered Spider threat actors search a  compromised network to discover files and  directories for further information or exploitation. Remote System Discovery  T1018  Scattered Spider threat actors search for  infrastructure, such as remote systems, to exploit. Table 13: Lateral Movement  Technique Title  ID  Use  Lateral Movement  TA0008  Scattered Spider threat actors laterally move  across a target network upon gaining access and  establishing persistence. Remote Services: Cloud  Services  T1021.007  Scattered Spider threat actors use pre-existing  cloud instances for lateral movement and data  collection. Table 14: Collection  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data from Information  Repositories: Code  Repositories  T1213.003  Scattered Spider threat actors search code  repositories for data collection and exfiltration. Data from Information  Repositories: Sharepoint  T1213.002  Scattered Spider threat actors search SharePoint  repositories for information. Data Staged  T1074  Scattered Spider threat actors stage data from  multiple data sources into a centralized database  before exfiltration. Email Collection  T1114  Scattered Spider threat actors search victim’s  emails to determine if the victim has detected the  intrusion and initiated any security response. Data from Cloud Storage  T1530  Scattered Spider threat actors search data in  cloud storage for collection and exfiltration. Scattered Spider threat actors leverage third-party  software to facilitate lateral movement and  maintain persistence on a target organization’s  network. Table 17: Impact  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data Encrypted for  Impact  T1486  Scattered Spider threat actors recently began  encrypting data on a target network and  demanding a ransom for decryption. Scattered Spider threat actors has been observed  encrypting VMware ESXi servers. Exfiltration Over Web  Service: Exfiltration to  Cloud Storage  T1567.002  Scattered Spider threat actors exfiltrate data to  multiple sites including U.S.-based data centers  and MEGA[.]NZ. CISA and NIST based the  CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and  guidance to protect against the most common and  impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures.   Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  o Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used and/or  authorized software. o Reviewing logs for execution of remote access software to detect abnormal use of  programs running as a portable executable [CPG 2.T]. o Using security software to detect instances of remote access software being loaded only  in memory. o Requiring authorized remote access solutions to be used only from within your network  over approved remote access solutions, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) or virtual  desktop interfaces (VDIs). o Blocking both inbound and outbound connections on common remote access  software ports and protocols at the network perimeter. o Applying recommendations in the Guide to Securing Remote Access Software. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats.   Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., ensure backup data cannot be  altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure [CPG 2.K, 2.L,  2.R]. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory.

Encryption  After mapping the network, the ransomware encrypts data using a 4096-bit RSA encryption key with a  ChaCha20 algorithm [T1486]. As shown in Figure 1, Rhysida ransomware drops a ransom  note named “CriticalBreachDetected” as a PDF file—the note provides each company with a unique  code and instructions to contact the group via a Tor-based portal. Command and  Scripting Interpreter:  Windows Command  Shell  T1059.003  Rhysida actors used batch scripting to place 1.ps1 on  victim systems to automate ransomware execution. FBI, CISA,  and the MS-ISAC recommend incorporating secure-by-design and -default principles, limiting the  impact of ransomware techniques and strengthening overall security posture. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a network monitoring tool.

VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE  ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The information in this CSA is derived from related incident response investigations  and malware analysis of samples discovered on victim networks."
#StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware Update,2023-11-13,4,"{'phishing': 6, 'extortion': 2, 'ransomware': 22, 'threats_of_violence': 25, 'malware': 1}"," Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts. Phishing emails are  among the most successful vectors for initial access by Royal threat actors. Initial Access  Royal actors gain initial access to victim networks in several ways including:     Phishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of  incidents) gain initial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566]. Phishing: Spear phishing  Attachment  T1566.001  The actors gain initial access through malicious  PDF attachments sent via email. Phishing: Spear phishing Link  T1566.002  The actors gain initial access using malvertising  links via emails and public-facing sites. Royal conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to  encryption and then publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption  percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors  also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if  the victim does not pay the ransom. TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-061A November 13, 2023 Coauthored by: TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware Update  SUMMARY  Update November 13, 2023  This CSA is being re-released to add new TTPs, IOCs, and information related to Royal Ransomware  activity. End of Update  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for  network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and  ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to  help  organizations  protect  against  ransomware. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Royal ransomware IOCs and TTPs  identified through FBI threat response activities as recently as June 2023. and international  organizations with Royal ransomware. After  gaining access to victims’ networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large  amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. Update November 13, 2023  Since September 2022, Royal has targeted over 350 known victims worldwide and ransomware  demands have exceeded 275 million USD. Blacksuit ransomware shares  a number of identified coding characteristics similar to Royal. A previous joint CSA for Royal  ransomware was published on March 2, 2023. End Update  FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Royal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a  specific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. Ransomware operators often  use open source projects to aid their intrusion activities—Royal operators have recently been  observed using Chisel, a tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to  communicate with their C2 infrastructure. FBI observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal  ransomware attacks but is yet to determine if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. Update November 13, 2023  See Tables 3 and 4 for Royal and Blacksuit Ransomware IOCs as of June 2023. FBI and CISA recommend that  software manufactures incorporate secure-by- design and -default principles and tactics into  their software development practices limiting the  impact of ransomware techniques (such as  threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities  into remote software systems) thus  strengthening the security posture for their  customers. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of  ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by  restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic [CPG 5.1], including lateral movement  activity on a network.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA’s and Multi-State Information Sharing and  Analysis Center’s (MS-ISAC’s) joint Ransomware Guide. Note: The joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best  practices as well as a ransomware response checklist. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other threat actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Since approximately September 2022, cyber threat actors have compromised U.S. Instead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to  directly interact with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). FBI has also observed Royal threat actors gain initial access  through exploiting public-facing applications [T1190]. Reports from trusted third-party sources indicate that Royal threat actors may  leverage brokers to gain initial access and source traffic by harvesting virtual private network  (VPN) credentials from stealer logs. Lateral Movement and Persistence  Royal threat actors often use RDP to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. FBI observed Royal threat  actors using remote monitoring and management (RMM) software such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and  Atera for persistence in the victim’s network [T1133]. In some instances, the threat actors moved  laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed case, the threat actors used a legitimate admin  account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once on the domain controller, the threat  actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001]. Exfiltration  Royal threat actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration  testing tools such as Cobalt Strike and malware tools and derivatives such as Ursnif/Gozi for data  aggregation and exfiltration. According to third-party reporting, Royal threat actors’ first hop in  exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S. See Table 5 for a list  of legitimate software used by Royal and Blacksuit threat actors identified through FBI investigations  as of June 2023. Threat actors have been observed using open source network  tunneling tools such as Chisel and Cloudflared, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) Client, OpenSSH, and  MobaXterm to establish SSH connections. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity  Performance Goals (CPGs), which provide a minimum  set of practices and protections that are informed by the  most common and impactful threats, TTPs, and yield  goals that all organizations across critical infrastructure  sectors should implement.   Implement a recovery plan to maintain and  retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers [CPG 7.3] in a physically  separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e.,  hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).   Reduce the threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by applying mitigations in  joint Guide to Securing Remote Access Software. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. REPORTING  FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication  to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Royal threat actors,  Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file."
Ransomware Actors Continue to Gain Access through Third Parties and Legitimate System Tools,2023-11-08,4,"{'phishing': 2, 'extortion': 1, 'ransomware': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 10, 'malware': 1}"," As of June 2023, the Silent Ransom Group (SRG), also called Luna Moth, conducted callback- phishing data theft and extortion attacks by sending victims a phone number in a phishing  attempt, usually relating to pending charges on the victims’ account.  Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent possible,  particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems. Threat  As of July 2023, the FBI noted several trends emerging or continuing across the ransomware  environment and is releasing this notification for industry awareness.

Initial Access Vector: Phishing  •  Implement a cybersecurity user awareness and  training program that includes guidance on how to  identify and report suspicious activity (e.g., phishing) or  incidents [CPG 2.I]. CISA offers a no-cost Phishing  Campaign Assessment and other  no-cost assessments. For example, OneNote attachments with embedded  malware have recently been used in phishing campaigns. This fully  managed security service prevents IT  systems from connecting to harmful web  domains and protects against cyber threats,  including:  • Malware,  • Ransomware, and   • Phishing. These  security services analyze DNS queries  and take action to mitigate threats—such  as malware, ransomware, phishing  attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and  spyware—leveraging the existing DNS  protocol and architecture. These links  then lead unsuspecting users to phishing sites,  malware downloads, and other cyber threats. Users may visit these sites by  responding to a phishing email or by clicking  on a deceptive pop-up window. • Email addresses used by the attackers and any  associated phishing emails. Upon voluntary request, CISA and MS-ISAC  (for SLTT organizations) can assist with  analysis of phishing emails, storage media,  logs, and/or malware at no cost to help  organizations understand the root cause of  an incident. •  Phishing email, storage media, log, and malware analysis based on voluntary submission. Part 1: Ransomware and Data  Extortion Preparation, Prevention,  and Mitigation Best Practices,  pages 8, and 9. Part 2: Ransomware and Data  Extortion Response Checklist p. The  application of both tactics is known as “double  extortion.” In some cases, malicious actors may  exfiltrate data and threaten to release it as their  sole form of extortion without employing  ransomware. The economic and reputational  impacts of ransomware and data extortion have  proven challenging and costly for organizations of  all sizes throughout the initial disruption and, at  times, extended recovery. This guide includes  two primary resources:  •  Part 1: Ransomware and Data Extortion  Prevention Best Practices  •  Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist  Part 1 provides guidance for all organizations to reduce the impact and likelihood of ransomware  incidents and data extortion, including best practices to prepare for, prevent, and mitigate these  incidents. These ransomware and data extortion prevention and response best practices and recommendations  are based on operational insight from CISA, MS-ISAC, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations. Preparing for Ransomware and Data Extortion Incidents  Refer to the best practices and references listed in this section to help manage the risks posed by  ransomware and to drive a coordinated and efficient response for your organization in the event of an  incident. •  Create, maintain, and regularly exercise a basic cyber incident response plan (IRP) and  associated communications plan that includes response and notification procedures for  ransomware and data extortion/breach incidents [CPG 2.S]. Preventing and Mitigating Ransomware and Data Extortion Incidents  Refer to the best practices and references listed in this section to help prevent and mitigate  ransomware and data extortion incidents.

Over time, malicious actors have  adjusted their ransomware tactics to be more  destructive and impactful and have also exfiltrated victim data and pressured victims to pay by  threatening to release the stolen data. This guide is an update to the Joint Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and  Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) Ransomware Guide released in  September 2020 (see What’s New) and was  developed through the JRTF. Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF). The JRTF, co-chaired by CISA and FBI, is an  interagency, collaborative effort to combat the  growing threat of ransomware attacks. The  JRTF was launched in response to a series of  high-profile ransomware attacks on U.S. Government's response to ransomware  attacks and facilitates information sharing  and collaboration between government  agencies and private sector partners. Ensures operational coordination for  activities such as developing and sharing  best practices for preventing and responding  to ransomware attacks, conducting joint  investigations and operations against  ransomware threat actors, and providing  guidance and resources to organizations  that have been victimized by ransomware. Represents a significant step forward in  enabling unity of effort across the U.S  Government's efforts to address the growing  threat of ransomware attacks. Engaging with peer organizations and CISA enables your organization to receive critical and timely  information and access to services for managing ransomware and other cyber threats. What’s New  Since the initial release of the Ransomware Guide in September 2020, ransomware actors have  accelerated their tactics and techniques. •  Incorporated the #StopRansomware effort into  the title. •  Expanded the ransomware response checklist with threat hunting tips for detection and  analysis. #StopRansomware is CISA and FBI’s effort  to publish advisories for network defenders  that detail network defense information  related to various ransomware variants and  threat actors. It is  important that backups are maintained offline, as most  ransomware actors attempt to find and subsequently  delete or encrypt accessible backups to make  restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid. o Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response  Checklist in this guide and Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook to:    Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response. These  macros can be used to deliver ransomware [CPG 2.N]. This  enables detection of both “precursor”  malware and ransomware. o A ransomware infection may be  evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of  existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet. o In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is  dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email  compromise (BEC). •  Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect command and control  activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware  deployment. • Impersonating employees: Ransomware actors  have posed as company IT and/or helpdesk  staff in phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to  the network. MSPs have been an infection vector for ransomware impacting numerous client organizations [CPG 1.I]. Malicious actors often leverage privileged accounts for network-wide ransomware attacks. Emerging ransomware strategies have begun targeting VMware ESXi servers, hypervisors, and other centralized tools and systems, which enables fast encryption of the infrastructure at scale. For more information about ransomware resilience and hardening of VMware and other virtualization infrastructure, see: o NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server- based Hypervisor Platforms o VMware: Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening • Leverage best practices and enable security settings in association with cloud environments, such as Microsoft Office 365. o Enable delete protection or object lock on storage resources often targeted in ransomware attacks (e.g., object storage, database storage, file storage, and block storage) to prevent data from being deleted or overwritten, respectively. Threat actors use PowerShell to deploy  ransomware and hide their malicious activities. Malicious actors often target and use DCs as a staging  point to spread ransomware network wide. Detection and Analysis  Refer to the best practices and references  below to help manage the risk posed by  ransomware and support your organization’s  coordinated and efficient response to a  ransomware incident. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their  access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline. Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid  further spread of the ransomware infection. Note: This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts  and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. Additionally, paying ransoms may pose sanctions  risks. Department of the Treasury Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) memorandum from  September 2021, Updated Advisory on Potential  Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware  Payments. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise.   Malicious actors often drop ransomware variants to obscure post-compromise  activity. Misuse of these tools is a  common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery. For example,  ransomware actors have used Chisel to tunnel Secure Shell (SSH) over  HTTPS port 443. Ransomware actors have also used Cloudflared to  abuse Cloudflare tunnels to tunnel communications over HTTPS. Consult federal law enforcement, even if mitigation actions are possible, regarding  possible decryptors available, as security researchers may have discovered encryption flaws  for some ransomware variants and released decryption or other types of tools. Government,  MS-ISAC, or a reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow any  additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that are confirmed to  be impacted. The designated IT or IT security authority declares the ransomware incident over  based on established criteria, which may include taking the steps above or seeking outside  assistance. What You Can Expect:  •  Specific guidance to help evaluate and remediate ransomware incidents. •  Remote assistance to identify the extent of the compromise and recommendations for  appropriate containment and mitigation strategies (dependent on specific ransomware variant). This  includes best practices and network defense information regarding ransomware trends and  variants as well as malware that is a precursor to ransomware. CSET includes the  Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), a self-assessment based on a tiered set of  practices to help organizations evaluate how well they are equipped to defend and recover from  a ransomware incident. •  Security Primer – Ransomware (MS-ISAC)—outlines opportunistic and strategic ransomware  campaigns, common infection vectors, and best practice recommendations. •  Institute for Security + Technology (IST) Blueprint for Ransomware Defense—an action plan for  ransomware mitigation, response, and recovery for small- and medium-sized enterprises. Added information about threat  actors impersonating  employees. The authoring organizations recommend that organizations take the following initial steps to prepare  and protect their facilities, personnel, and customers from cyber and physical security threats and other  hazards:  •  Join a sector-based information sharing and analysis center (ISAC), where eligible, such as:  o MS-ISAC for U.S. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on  existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful  threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly  secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using  compromised credentials.   PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry  interaction and possible tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor’s  PowerShell use. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and  then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further  extort the victim and pressure them into paying. •  Presence of Rclone, Rsync, and various web-based file storage services,  and FTP/SFTP, which are common tools for data exfiltration (and also  used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on affected networks.)    Newly created services, unexpected scheduled tasks, unexpected software  installed, unusual files created, legitimate processes with unexpected child  processes, etc. PURPOSE  This document was developed in furtherance of the authors’ cybersecurity missions, including their  responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and to develop and issue cybersecurity  specifications and mitigations. •  Harden SMBv3 by implementing the following guidance as malicious actors use SMB to  propagate malware across organizations. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s post Anti-malware  protection in EOP. o Malware is often compressed in password protected archives that evade antivirus  scanning and email filters. •  Monitor indicators of activity and block malware file creation with the Windows Sysmon  utility. •  Consider implementing sandboxed  browsers to protect systems from  malware originating from web browsing. Malicious  actors use drive-by downloads to steal and  collect personal information, inject trojans, or  introduce exploit kits or other malware to  endpoints. • “Malvertising”: Malicious advertising that  cybercriminals use to inject malware to users’  computers when they visit malicious websites  or click an online advertisement. Malvertising  may also direct users to a corrupted website  where their data can be stolen, or malware can  be downloaded onto their computer.   The authoring organizations recommend using Windows Server 2019 or greater  and Windows 10 or greater as they have security features, such as LSASS  protections with Windows Credential Guard, Windows Defender, and  Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), not included in older operating system  o Ensure that DCs are regularly patched. Doing so can highlight evidence of additional  systems or malware involved in earlier stages of the attack. □ Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware, such as Bumblebee, Dridex, Emotet,  QakBot, or Anchor.   Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a  network. Care must be taken to identify such dropper malware before rebuilding  from backups to prevent continuing compromises. • Names of malware identified on your network. Collect any  relevant logs as well as samples of any  “precursor” malware binaries and associated  observables or indicators of compromise  (e.g., suspected command and control IP  addresses, suspicious registry entries, or  other relevant files detected). •  Assistance in conducting a criminal investigation, which may involve collecting incident artifacts,  including system images and malware samples."
Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One,2023-10-18,4,"{'phishing': 39, 'threats_of_violence': 10, 'malware': 22}","TLP:CLEAR  PHISHING GUIDANCE:  STOPPING THE ATTACK  CYCLE AT PHASE ONE  Publication: October 2023  Disclaimer: This document is marked TLP:CLEAR. Phishing is a form of  social engineering where malicious actors lure victims (typically  via email) to visit a malicious site or deceive them into providing  login credentials. Malicious actors primarily leverage phishing  for:  •  Obtaining login credentials. Malicious actors conduct  phishing campaigns to steal login credentials for initial  network access. Malicious actors commonly conduct  phishing campaigns to deploy malware for follow-on activity,  such as interrupting or damaging systems, escalating user  privileges, and maintaining persistence on compromised  systems. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint guide to outline phishing  techniques malicious actors commonly use and to provide  guidance for both network defenders and software  manufacturers. This will help to reduce the impact of phishing  attacks in obtaining credentials and deploying malware. Therefore, this guide includes a section of  tailored recommendations for small- and medium-sized  businesses that may not have the resources to hire IT staff  dedicated to a constant defense against phishing threats. Manufacturers  should develop and supply software that is secure against the  most prevalent phishing threats, thereby increasing the  cybersecurity posture of their customers. Despite this, if weak forms of MFA are enabled, malicious actors can  still obtain access through phishing and other techniques. MALWARE-BASED PHISHING  DEFINITION  In malware-based phishing attacks, Malicious actors pose as trustworthy sources (e.g., colleagues,  acquaintances, or organizations) to lure a victim into interacting with a malicious hyperlink or  opening an email attachment to execute malware on host systems. o Malicious actors may use free, publicly available tools (such as GoPhish or Zphisher) to  facilitate spearphishing campaigns where individual users are targeted with specific and  convincing lures. PROTECTING LOGIN CREDENTIALS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations implement the following to reduce the  likelihood of successful login credential phishing. o See CISA Insights Enhance Email and Web Security and the Center for Internet Security’s  (CIS’s) page on DMARC, as well as Microsoft’s Anti-Spoofing guidance for more  information.[1]  •  Implement internal mail and messaging monitoring. These forms of MFA are phishing  resistant and resilient against the threats listed in previous sections. If an organization  that uses mobile push-notification based MFA is unable to implement phishing-resistant  MFA, use number matching to mitigate MFA fatigue. o Prioritizing phishing-resistant MFA for administrator and privileged user accounts, such  as those with access to e-discovery tools or broad access to customer or financial data. SSO is a user  lifecycle management mechanism that—among other benefits—can reduce the chance of  users being socially engineered to give up their login credentials, especially when paired  with MFA or phishing-resistant MFA. o Identify and remediate successful phishing attempts. o Promptly report phishing incidents (see the Reporting section). PREVENTING MALWARE EXECUTION  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations implement the following to reduce the  likelihood of successful malware execution following phishing attacks. o For more information on protective phishing filters, refer to Microsoft, MacOS, or Google’s  guidance on phishing and malware protection.[2],[3],[4],[5] CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC  recommend reaching out to vendors or service providers to learn about what phishing  filters and malware protections are available. SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES (SMBs) OR ORGANIZATIONS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend that small- and medium-sized organizations with limited  resources prioritize the following best practices to protect network resources from prevalent phishing  threats:  •  User phishing awareness training: Implement a standard anti-phishing training program and  require employees to review phishing training material annually. o Small businesses are encouraged to implement commercial phishing awareness training  programs to employees. Additionally, NIST offers free anti-phishing training resources for  small businesses on their Small Business Cybersecurity Corner: Phishing webpage. o The Department of Justice (DOJ) offers Anti-Phishing Training Program Support to federal  organizations. o The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers guidance to protect small businesses from  phishing threats on their Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Phishing webpage. •  Identify network phishing vulnerabilities: Federal organizations are encouraged to participate in  CISA’s Phishing Vulnerability Scanning assessment service. •  Enable MFA: Activating a strong MFA is the best way that small businesses can protect their  internet facing business accounts from phishing related threats. Additionally, CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend SMBs implement the technical solutions  below to prevent phishing related compromises:  •  Implement strong password policies to authenticate users. Providers also commonly perform robust email traffic monitoring and anti- phishing malware services. SOFTWARE MANUFACTURERS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend software manufacturers incorporate secure-by-design and ­ default principles and tactics into their software development practices, reducing the susceptibility of  their customers to phishing attacks. To mitigate the success of phishing emails reaching users and users interacting with the email, the  authoring organizations recommend the following:  •  Perform field testing of email software. To mitigate successful malware execution following phishing attacks:  •  Ensure phishing filtering and blocking mechanisms are packaged with email software by default  to prevent successful malware deployment. INCIDENT RESPONSE  If an organization identifies compromised credentials and/or successful malware from phishing  activity, remediate the activity by:  1. Auditing account access following a confirmed phishing incident to ensure malicious actors  no longer have access to the initially impacted account. Isolating the affected workstation after the detection of a phishing attack. Reporting suspicious phishing activity is one of the most efficient methods for protecting  organizations as it helps email service providers identify new or trending phishing attacks. •  To report spoofing or phishing attempts (or to report that you've been a victim), file a complaint  with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), or contact your local FBI Field Office to  report an incident. MITIGATIONS  ALL ORGANIZATIONS  The mitigations below align with Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed for  organizations by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help mitigate  the most prevalent cyber threats to organizational networks. o DMARC reports provide a mechanism for notifying the owner of a spoofed domain  including the source of an apparent forger (information they would not receive  otherwise.)  o Enable DMARC policies to lower the chance of cyber threat actors crafting emails that  appear to come from your organization’s domain(s). •  Implement free security tools, such as OpenDNS Home, to prevent cyber threat actors from  redirecting users to malicious websites to steal their credentials. Implement threat modeling to test the email software  against various deployment scenarios while considering use-cases for organizations ranging from  small to large and configure the software with secure defaults based on the test findings. EXAMPLE TECHNIQUES  To execute malware on host systems, malicious actors commonly:  •  Send malicious hyperlinks or attachments that cause a user to download malware, facilitating  initial access, information stealing, damage or disruption to systems or services, and/or the  escalation of account privileges. •  Use smartphone or tablet apps, along with SMS, to send text messages or chats in collaboration  platforms (i.e., Slack, Teams, Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook Messenger) to lure  users into interacting with a malicious hyperlink or attachment that executes malware. •  Incorporate denylists at the email gateway and enable firewall rules to prevent successful  malware deployment. •  Implement remote browser isolation (RBI) solutions that prevent malware propagation through  quarantining the malware sample upon user execution. RBI solutions run applications that  quarantine malware when a user interacts with a malicious link or binary to prevent further  spread into the environment. Configure RBI solutions in remote workstations so that any  malware is contained within an isolation boundary and cannot access an organization’s  resources. •  Implement free security tools like Quad9 or Google Safe Browsing to identify and stop malware  upon user execution. •  Implement anti-virus solutions to mitigate malware and to stop malware from executing if a  malicious hyperlink or attachment from an email is opened. These policies also prevent users from visiting malicious websites  that often contain malware that can either harvest user credentials or deploy additional malware  to damage organizational systems. This helps stop the  executed malware from spreading further into the organization’s network. After isolating the affected workstation(s), have the malware  analyzed by a team that specializes in malware analysis. After analysis,  specialists will know how to safely handle the malware. Learn more by visiting CISA’s  malware analysis services and resources webpage. Eradicate the malware from the network so other workstations  within the organization’s networks can no longer be negatively impacted by the executed  malware."
Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security by Design and Default,2023-10-16,4,"{'phishing': 3, 'threats_of_violence': 15}","For example, SaaS  providers should publish statistics on their  internal deployment of phishing-resistant  MFA, like Fast Identity Online (FIDO)  authentication. Ideally, they should be able  to say that no staff member can access  customer or other sensitive data without  authenticating via phishing-resistant MFA. If a manufacturer  fails to meet the CPGs— such as not requiring phishing-resistant MFA for all  employees— then they cannot be seen as delivering secure by design products. Software  manufacturers should perform a risk assessment to identify and enumerate  prevalent cyber threats to critical systems, and then include protections in  product blueprints that account for the evolving cyber threat landscape. The authoring organizations further  recommend manufacturers use a tailored threat model during the product  development stage to address all potential threats to a system and account  for each system’s deployment process. These  products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities  without end-users having to take additional steps to secure them. Use a tailored threat model during resource allocation and development to prioritize  the most critical and high-impact features. Threat models consider a product’s specific  use-case and enables development teams to fortify products. Explicit  threat modeling is a tactic that may help inform the decision of which features should be  on by default or which settings are needed to be secure by default. An application’s settings should be continuously evaluated whether the settings were the  default or set by the customer, against the manufacturer’s current understanding of the  threat landscape. It helps those conventions change over time in response to customer  needs, changes in threat actor tactics or economics, or technology evolution. Conversations about information sharing should  expand beyond real-time threat indicators, to include the elements below. If we are to collectively overcome the threats posed by intelligent  and adaptive adversaries, we must embrace levels of transparency that will  feel uncomfortable today, but that will drive the industry forward. Secure by design products start with  written threat models that describe  what the creators are trying to protect  and from whom. Effective threat models  are informed by the way intrusions  happen in the wild, and should cover  both the enterprise and development  environments, as well as the way the  software manufacturers intend for it to be  used in customer environments. Chief information security  officer (CISO) reports to corporate boards  usually include information about current  and planned security programs, threats,  suspected and confirmed security incidents,  and other updates centered on the security  posture and health of the company. As such, their introduction should be prioritized based on  tailored threat modeling, criticality, complexity, and business impact. When configuration is  necessary, the default option should be broadly secure against common threats."
Threat Actors Exploit Atlassian Confluence CVE-2023-22515 for Initial Access to Networks,2023-10-16,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 13}","While not observed in this instance of exploitation, mandating phishing-resistant multifactor  authentication (MFA) for all staff and services can make it more difficult for threat actors to  gain access to networks and information systems.

This recently  disclosed vulnerability affects certain versions of Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Server,  enabling malicious cyber threat actors to obtain initial access to Confluence instances by creating  unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts. Threat actors exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero- day to obtain access to victim systems and continue active exploitation post-patch. •  8.0.0  •  8.0.1  •  8.0.2  •  8.0.3  •  8.0.4  •  8.1.0  •  8.1.1  •  8.1.3  •  8.1.4  •  8.2.0  •  8.2.1  •  8.2.2  •  8.2.3  •  8.3.0  •  8.3.1  •  8.3.2  •  8.4.0  •  8.4.1  •  8.4.2  •  8.5.0  •  8.5.1  Unauthenticated remote threat actors can exploit this vulnerability to create unauthorized Confluence  administrator accounts and access Confluence instances. More specifically, threat actors can change  the Confluence server’s configuration to indicate the setup is not complete and use the  /setup/setupadministrator.action endpoint to create a new administrator user. Considering the root cause of the vulnerability allows threat actors to modify critical configuration  settings, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC assess that the threat actors may not be limited to creating new  administrator accounts. Open source further indicates an Open Web Application Security Project  (OWASP) classification of injection (i.e., CWE-20: Improper Input Validation) is an appropriate  description.[2] Atlassian released a patch on October 4, 2023, and confirmed that threat actors  exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero-day—a previously unidentified vulnerability.[1]  On October 5, 2023, CISA added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog  based on evidence of active exploitation. Threat  actors were observed using Rclone to either upload a configuration file to victim infrastructure or enter  cloud storage credentials via the command line. Note: As additional threat actors  begin to use this CVE due to the availability of publicly posted proof-of-concept code, an increasing  variation in User-Agent strings is expected. INCIDENT RESPONSE  Organizations are encouraged to review all affected Confluence instances for evidence of  compromise, as outlined by Atlassian.[1] If compromise is suspected or detected, organizations  should assume that threat actors hold full administrative access and can perform any number of  unfettered actions—these include but are not limited to exfiltration of content and system credentials,  as well as installation of malicious plugins. Note: Upgrading to fixed versions, as well as removing malicious administrator  accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering threat actors may have established  additional persistence mechanisms. Malicious cyber threat actors who exploit the affected instance can escalate to  administrative privileges."

Improving Security of Open Source Software in Operational Technology and Industrial Control Systems,2023-10-11,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 3}","As identified in the 2015  Ukrainian power grid compromise[4], threat actors sent phishing emails targeting IT networks before pivoting to the ICS  environment and deploying BlackEnergy malware. This highlights the need for securing systems at the IT level to  reduce the likelihood of a threat actor pivoting to OT systems connected to IT infrastructure. Supply Chain Risks  As a result of the connections between OT and IT networks, OT systems are too often exposed to cyber threat actors  targeting control systems and the critical infrastructure they operate. To counter these threats, the cybersecurity  community recommends that defenders and operators keep all OT and IT systems up to date with patches and security  updates to address known exploited vulnerabilities. However, patching and security updates create opportunities for  threat actors to affect the OT supply chain—malicious threat actors can compromise the supply chain by embedding  malware in a patch or by compromising the website that hosts the patch, such as replacing the patch itself with malware  (known as a ‘watering hole’). Risk Exposure Reduction  CISA offers a range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing to help organizations reduce exposure to threats  via mitigating attack vectors. However, these controls can be difficult to correctly implement and are especially important in OT environments, which  are less likely to maintain defense-in-depth security controls once a threat actor breaches the network boundary and  obtains initial access to the environment. For example, Havex malware used legitimate system update installers to deploy and execute the malware  along with the normal software update process."
Two or More Ransomware Variants Impacting the Same Victims and Data Destruction Trends,2023-09-28,3,"{'phishing': 1, 'ransomware': 18, 'threats_of_violence': 10, 'malware': 3}"," Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent possible,  particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems. Threat  As of July 2023, the FBI noted two trends emerging across the ransomware environment and is  releasing this notification for industry awareness. These new trends included multiple  ransomware attacks on the same victim in close date proximity and new data destruction  tactics in ransomware attacks. TLP:CLEAR        TLP:CLEAR   The FBI noted a trend of dual ransomware attacks conducted in close proximity to one  another.1 During these attacks, cyber threat actors deployed two different ransomware variants  against victim companies from the following variants: AvosLocker, Diamond, Hive, Karakurt,  LockBit, Quantum, and Royal. This use of dual  ransomware variants resulted in a combination of data encryption, exfiltration, and financial  losses from ransom payments. Second ransomware attacks against an already compromised  system could significantly harm victim entities.  In early 2022, multiple ransomware groups increased use of custom data theft, wiper tools, and  malware to pressure victims to negotiate. The FBI and recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by ransomware:    Preparing for Cyber Incidents -   Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. 1 Ransomware attacks against the same victim occurring within 10 days, or less, of each other were considered dual ransomware  attacks. The majority of dual ransomware attacks occurred within 48 hours of each other. Protective Controls and Architecture -   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.

Snatch  threat actors conduct ransomware operations involving data exfiltration and double extortion. After  data exfiltration often involving direct communications with victims demanding ransom, Snatch threat  actors may threaten victims with double extortion, where the victims’ data will be posted on Snatch’s  extortion blog if the ransom goes unpaid. Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware  variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data  released on Snatch’s extortion blog. Note: Since November 2021, an extortion site operating under  the name Snatch served as a clearinghouse for data exfiltrated or stolen from victim companies on  Clearnet and TOR hosted by a bulletproof hosting service. Snatch threat actors communicate with their victims  through email and the Tox communication platform based on identifiers left in ransom notes or  through their extortion blog.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated  with the Snatch ransomware variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 1, 2023. Since mid-2021, Snatch threat actors have consistently evolved their tactics to take advantage of  current trends in the cybercriminal space and leveraged successes of other ransomware variants’  operations. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. First appearing in 2018, Snatch operates a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and claimed their  first U.S.-based victim in 2019. Snatch  threat actors use a customized ransomware variant notable for rebooting devices into Safe Mode  [T1562.009], enabling the ransomware to circumvent detection by antivirus or endpoint protection,  and then encrypting files when few services are running. In August 2023, individuals claiming to be  associated with the blog gave a media interview claiming the blog was not associated with Snatch  ransomware and “none of our targets has been attacked by Ransomware Snatch…”, despite multiple  confirmed Snatch victims’ data appearing on the blog alongside victims associated with other  ransomware groups, notably Nokoyawa and Conti.[1]  Initial Access and Persistence  Snatch threat actors employ several different methods to gain access to and maintain persistence on  a victim’s network. Prior to deploying the ransomware, Snatch threat actors were observed spending up to three months  on a victim’s system. Defense Evasion and Execution  During the early stages of ransomware deployment, Snatch threat actors attempt to disable antivirus  software [T1562.001] and run an executable as a file named safe.exe or some variation thereof. In  recent victims, the ransomware executable’s name consisted of a string of hexadecimal characters  which match the SHA-256 hash of the file in an effort to defeat rule-based detection [T1036]. Upon  initiation, the Snatch ransomware payload queries and modifies registry keys [T1012][T1112], uses  various native Windows tools to enumerate the system [T1569.002], finds processes [T1057], and  creates benign processes to execute Windows batch (.bat) files [T1059.003]. The Snatch ransomware executable appends a series of hexadecimal characters to each file and  folder name it encrypts—unique to each infection—and leaves behind a text file titled HOW TO  RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT in each folder. In some instances, Snatch victims had a different ransomware variant deployed on their  systems, but received a ransom note from Snatch threat actors.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Snatch threat actors have targeted a wide range of critical infrastructure sectors including  the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), Food and Agriculture, and Information Technology sectors. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. Snatch threat actors gain persistence on a victim’s network by compromising an administrator  account [T1078.002] and establishing connections over port 443 [T1071.001] to a command and  control (C2) server located on a Russian bulletproof hosting service [T1583.003]. Per IP traffic from  event logs provided by recent victims, Snatch threat actors initiated RDP connections from a Russian  bulletproof hosting service and through other virtual private network (VPN) services [T1133]. Data Discovery and Lateral Movement  Snatch threat actors were observed using different TTPs to discover data, move laterally, and search  for data to exfiltrate. Snatch threat actors use sc.exe to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add  system services using the Windows Command line. In addition to sc.exe, Snatch threat actors also  use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike [S0154]. Email Domains and Addresses  Since 2019, Snatch threat actors have used numerous email addresses to email victims. The use of  these email domains by a threat actor should not be attributed to the email domains, absent specific  articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.

Analysts confirmed that nation-state advanced  persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2022- 47966 to gain unauthorized access to a public-facing  application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus),  establish persistence, and move laterally through the  network. CISA and co-sealers identified an array of threat actor activity, to include overlapping TTPs across  multiple APT actors. In recent years, Ngrok has been leveraged  maliciously by a variety of threat actors,  including use for persistence, lateral  movement, and data exfiltration.[4],[5],[6]  Using Ngrok as an external service, APT  actors were able to gain access to and utilize  the command line on victim systems. APT actors’ specific use of Meterpreter—an  attack payload of Metasploit—serves as an  interactive shell and allows threat actors to  control and execute code on a system. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to  protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. CISA offers a  range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing to help organizations reduce  exposure to threats via mitigating attack vectors. Proper network segmentation significantly reduces the ability for threat actor  lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks. •  Implement the principle of least privilege to decrease threat actors’ abilities to access key  network resources. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and co-sealers recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE  ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory.

Identification and Disruption of QakBot Infrastructure,2023-08-30,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 12, 'threats_of_violence': 9, 'botnet': 5, 'malware': 12}","•  Use phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) [CPG 2.H] (e.g., security tokens)  for remote access and access to any sensitive data repositories. Implement phishing-resistant  MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail and VPNs—for accounts that  access critical systems and privileged accounts that manage backups. CISA and FBI encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related activity and promote identification of QakBot-facilitated  ransomware and malware infections. Note: The disruption of QakBot infrastructure does not mitigate  other previously installed malware or ransomware on victim computers. QakBot has been the precursor to a significant amount of computer  intrusions, to include ransomware and the compromise of user accounts within the Financial Sector. Since its initial inception as a banking trojan, QakBot has evolved into a multi-purpose botnet and  malware variant that provides threat actors with a wide range of capabilities, to include performing  reconnaissance, engaging in lateral movement, gathering and exfiltrating data, and delivering other  malicious payloads, including ransomware, on affected devices. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the  recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related  infections and promote identification of QakBot-induced ransomware and malware infections. Disruption of the QakBot botnet does not mitigate other previously installed malware or ransomware  on victim computers. QakBot infections are particularly known to precede  the deployment of human-operated ransomware, including Conti[2], ProLock[3], Egregor[4], REvil[5],  MegaCortex[6], Black Basta[7], Royal[8], and PwndLocker. Disruption of the QakBot botnet does not mitigate other already-installed malware or  ransomware on victim computers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks to restrict adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  CISA has released a new module in its Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET), the  Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA). Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage  other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Access to QakBot-affected (victim) devices  via compromised credentials are often sold to further the goals of the threat actor who delivered  QakBot. These providers lease servers to malicious threat actors, ignore  abuse complaints, and do not cooperate with law enforcement. Indicators of Compromise  FBI has observed the following threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in association  with OakBot infections:  1. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing  cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats  and TTPs. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. CISA offers a range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing  to help organizations reduce exposure to threats via mitigating attack vectors. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and FBI recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. Disruption operations targeting QakBot infrastructure resulted in the botnet takeover,  which severed the connection between victim computers and QakBot command and control (C2)  servers. At any given time, thousands of victim  computers running Microsoft Windows were infected with QakBot—the botnet was controlled through  three tiers of C2 servers. The FBI is working closely with industry partners to share information about the malware to  maximize detection, remediation, and prevention measures for network defenders. TECHNICAL DETAILS  Overview  QakBot—also known as Qbot, Quackbot, Pinkslipbot, and TA570—is responsible for thousands of  malware infections globally. QakBot Infrastructure  QakBot’s modular structure allows for various malicious features, including process and web injection,  victim network enumeration and credential stealing, and the delivery of follow-on payloads such as  Cobalt Strike[1], Brute Ratel, and other malware. Organizations are encouraged to review any connections with these IP addresses, which could  potentially indicate a QakBot and/or follow-on malware infection. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated malware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the malware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on  a network."

To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on  a network. and  Canada Based Networks  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Canadian Centre  for Cyber Security (CCCS) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to cyber  threat actors leveraging newly identified Truebot malware variants against organizations in the United  States and Canada. As recently as May 31, 2023, the authoring organizations have observed an  increase in cyber threat actors using new malware variants of Truebot (also known as  Silence.Downloader). See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section below for cyber threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Initial Access and Execution  In recent months, open source reporting has detailed an increase in Truebot malware infections,  particularly cyber threat actors using new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and delivery  methods.[2] Based on the nature of observed Truebot operations, the primary objective of a Truebot  infection is to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised host(s) for financial gain [TA0010]. Cyber threat actors have further been observed concealing email  attachments (executables) as software update notifications [T1189] that appear to be  legitimate [T1204.002][T1566.002]. Through exploitation of this CVE, cyber threat actors gain initial  access, as well as the ability to move laterally within the compromised network [T1210]. In  this instance, cyber threat actors can redirect victims to malicious domains and further establish a C2  connection. Cobalt Strike (Tool)  Cobalt Strike is a popular remote access tool (RAT) that cyber threat actors have leveraged—in an  observable manner—for a variety of post-exploitation means. Typically a few hours after Truebot’s  execution phase, cyber threat actors have been observed deploying additional payloads containing  Cobalt Strike beacons for persistence and data exfiltration purposes [T1059].[2] Cyber threat actors  use Cobalt Strike to move laterally via remote service session hijacking [T1563.001][T1563.002],  collecting valid credentials through LSASS memory credential dumping, or creating local admin  accounts to achieve pass the hash alternate authentication [T1003.001][T1550.002]. Teleport (Tool)  Cyber threat actors have been observed using a custom data exfiltration tool, which Talos has named  “Teleport.”[2] Teleport is known to evade detection during data exfiltration by using an encryption key  hardcoded in the binary and a custom communication protocol [T1095] that encrypts data using  advanced encryption standard (AES) and a hardcoded key [T1048][T1573.002]. Drive-by Compromise  T1189  Cyber threat actors embed malicious links or  attachments within web domains to gain initial  access. Exploit Public-Facing  Application  T1190  Cyber threat actors are exploiting Netwrix  vulnerability CVE-2022-31199 for initial access  with follow-on capabilities of lateral movement  through remote code execution. Table 7: Execution  Technique Title  ID  Use  Command and  Scripting Interpreter  T1059  Cyber threat actors have been observed dropping  cobalt strike beacons as a reverse shell proxy to  create persistence within the compromised  network. Cyber threat actors use FlawedGrace to receive  PowerShell commands over a C2 channel to  deploy additional tools. Shared Modules  T1129  Cyber threat actors can deploy malicious payloads  through obfuscated share modules. User Execution:  Malicious Link  T1204.001  Cyber threat actors trick users into clicking a link  by making them believe they need to perform a  Google Chrome software update. Obfuscated Files or  Information: Binary  Padding  T1027.001  Cyber threat actors embed around one gigabyte of  junk code within the malware string to evade  detection protocols. Masquerading:  Masquerade File Type  T1036.008  Cyber threat actors hide Truebot malware as  legitimate appearing file formats. Table 11: Credential Access  Technique Title  ID  Use  OS Credential  Dumping: LSASS  Memory  T1003.001  Cyber threat actors use cobalt strike to gain valid  credentials through LSASS memory dumping. Table 13: Lateral Movement  Technique Title  ID  Use  Exploitation of Remote  Services  T1210  Cyber threat actors exploit CVE-2022-31199  Netwrix Auditor vulnerability and use its  capabilities to move laterally within a  compromised network.

Lateral Tool Transfer  T1570  Cyber threat actors deploy additional payloads to  transfer toolsets and move laterally. Table 15: Command and Control  Technique Title  ID  Use  Application Layer  Protocol  T1071  Cyber threat actors use teleport exfiltration tool to  blend exfiltrated data with network traffic. Non-Application  Protocol  T1095  Cyber threat actors use Teleport and  FlawedGrace to send data over custom  communication protocol. Ingress Transfer Tool  T1105  Cyber threat actors deploy various ingress transfer  tool payloads to move laterally and establish C2  connections. Encrypted Channel:  Asymmetric  Cryptography  T1573.002  Cyber threat actors use Teleport to create an  encrypted channel using AES. Exfiltration Over C2  Channel  T1048  Cyber threat actors blend exfiltrated data with  network traffic to evade detection. Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  •  Implementing application controls to manage and control execution of software,  including allowlisting remote access programs. o  PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and  possible IOCs of a cyber threat actor’s PowerShell use. •  Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o  Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of  password hashes locally. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. Discovery and Defense Evasion  During the first stage of Truebot’s execution process, it checks the current version of the operating  system (OS) with RtlGetVersion and processor architecture using GetNativeSystemInfo  [T1082].[4] Note: This variant of Truebot malware is designed with over one gigabyte (GB) of junk  code which functions to hinder detection and analysis efforts [T1027.001]. Truebot malware has the capability to download additional malicious  modules [T1105], load shell code [T1620], and deploy various tools to stealthily navigate an infected  network.

Debugger Evasion  T1622  Truebot malware scans the compromised  environment for debugger tools and enumerates  them in effort to evade network defenses. Table 14: Collection  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data from Local  System  T1005  Truebot malware checks the current version of the  OS and the processor architecture and compiles  the information it receives. Screen Capture  T1113  Truebot malware takes snapshots of local host  data, specifically processor architecture data, and  sends that to a phase 2 encoded data string. DETECTION METHODS  CISA and authoring organizations recommend that organizations review and implement the following  detection signatures, along with: Win/malicious_confidence100% (W),  Trojan:Win32/Tnega!MSR, and Trojan.Agent.Truebot.Gen, as well as YARA rules below to help  detect Truebot malware."
Understanding Ransomware Threat Actors: LockBit,2023-06-14,2,"{'phishing': 5, 'extortion': 5, 'ransomware': 52, 'threats_of_violence': 17, 'malware': 5}","Phishing  T1566  LockBit affiliates use phishing and  spearphishing to gain access to victims'  networks. •  Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and privileged accounts that access  critical systems [CPG 2.H]. •  Raise awareness for phishing threats in your organization. Phishing is one of the primary  infection vectors in ransomware campaigns, and all employees should receive practical  training on the risks associated with the regular use of  email. With the rise of sophisticated  phishing methods, such as using stolen email communication or artificial intelligence (AI)  systems such as ChatGPT, the distinction between legitimate and malicious emails becomes  more complex. The term 'victims' may include  those who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack  having taken place). The leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates’ victims subjected to secondary extortion. Since 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then  exfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Post Detonation TTPs  When LockBit affiliates target an organization responsible for managing other organizations’  networks, CERT NZ has observed LockBit affiliates attempt secondary ransomware extortion after  detonation of the LockBit variant on the primary target. This extortion is in the  form of secondary ransomware that locks down services those customers consume. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)  model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools  and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit  ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This  variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to  maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international  partners, hereafter referred to as “authoring organizations,” are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory  (CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended  mitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization’s defenses against  this ransomware operation. •  Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)  •  Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)  •  United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  •  National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI)  •  Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  •  New Zealand’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) and National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC NZ)   The authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this  CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider  in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group  maintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant  to individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as “affiliates”), and supports affiliates’  deployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits,  or a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit  and other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing  ransomware. Table 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS  Date  Event  September 2019  First observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor  to LockBit. [4]   January 2020  LockBit-named ransomware first seen on Russian-language  based cybercrime forums. [5]  March 2022  Emergence of LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, that  shares similarities with BlackMatter and Alphv (also known as  BlackCat) ransomware. [2, 6]  January 2023  Arrival of LockBit Green incorporating source code from Conti  ransomware. [7]  April 2023  LockBit ransomware encryptors targeting macOS seen on  VirusTotal [8, 9]    LockBit 2.0, LockBit 3.0, LockBit Green, and LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker are still available for affiliates’  use on LockBit’s panel. LockBit Statistics  Percentage of ransomware incidents attributed to LockBit:  •  Australia: From April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, LockBit made up 18% of total reported  Australian ransomware incidents. This figure includes all variants of LockBit ransomware, not  solely LockBit 3.0. •  Canada: In 2022, LockBit was responsible for 22% of attributed ransomware incidents in  Canada.[10]  •  New Zealand: In 2022, CERT NZ received 15 reports of LockBit ransomware, representing  23% of 2022 ransomware reports. •  United States: In 2022, 16% of the State, Local, Tribal, and Tribunal (SLTT) government  ransomware incidents reported to the MS-ISAC were identified as LockBit attacks. This  included ransomware incidents impacting municipal governments, county governments, public  higher education and K-12 schools, and emergency services (e.g., law enforcement). •  New Zealand: The first recorded incident involving LockBit ransomware was in March 2021. Operational activity related to LockBit in France  Since the first case in July 2020 to present, ANSSI has handled 80 alerts linked to the LockBit  ransomware, which accounts for 11% of all ransomware cases handled by ANSSI in that period. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall  ransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR). For these reasons, the leak  sites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data  publication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware  attacks. Table 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed  for ransomware operations. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Isolate web-facing  applications to further minimize the spread of ransomware across a network [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network [CPG 1.E]. Implement Mitigations for Defense-in-Depth  Implementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against  ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it by  applying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond  to ransomware before an organization’s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack  vectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in  this advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack  is broken into three phases:   •  Initial Access where the cyber actor is looking for a way into a network. Figure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop  a ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data.

In 2019, TA505 actors  leveraged CL0P ransomware as the final payload of a phishing campaign involving a macro-enabled  document that used a Get2 malware dropper for downloading SDBot and FlawedGrace. Considered to be one of the largest phishing and malspam distributors  worldwide, TA505 is estimated to have compromised more than 3,000 U.S.-based organizations and  8,000 global organizations. TA505 has operated:   •  A RaaS and has acted as an affiliate of other RaaS operations,  •  As an initial access broker (IAB), selling access to compromised corporate networks,   •  As a customer of other IABs,   •  And as a large botnet operator specializing in financial fraud and phishing attacks.

CL0P was previously known for its  use of the ‘double extortion’ tactic of stealing and encrypting victim data, refusing to restore victim  access and publishing exfiltrated data on Tor via the CL0P^_-LEAKS website. In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the  following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network  discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or  data extortion actors:   • Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or  proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location  (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). The ransom notes  threatened to publish the stolen files on the CL0P data leak site if victims did not pay the ransom  amount.

End of Update    Note: this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for  network defenders that detail various ransomware variants  and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware  advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of  compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known CL0P  ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI  investigations as recently as June 2023. According to open source information, beginning on May 27,  2023, CL0P Ransomware Gang, also known as TA505,  began exploiting a previously unknown SQL injection  vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) in Progress Software's managed file transfer (MFT) solution known  as MOVEit Transfer. Internet-facing MOVEit Transfer web applications were infected with a web shell  Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from CL0P  ransomware:   - Take an inventory of assets and  data, identifying authorized and  unauthorized devices and  software. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of CL0P ransomware and other ransomware  incidents. Beyond CL0P ransomware, TA505 is known for frequently changing malware and driving global trends  in criminal malware distribution. In late January 2023, the CL0P ransomware group launched a campaign using a zero-day vulnerability,  now catalogued as CVE-2023-0669, to target the GoAnywhere MFT platform. In May 2023, the CL0P  ransomware group exploited a SQL injection zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-34362 to install a web  shell named LEMURLOOT on MOVEit Transfer web applications [T1190] [1]. Remote Service Session Hijacking:  RDP Hijacking  T1563.002  CL0P ransomware actors have been observed  using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to interact  with compromised systems after initial access. • Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can  help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and  access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG  2.F]. • Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. MITIGATIONS  The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to  improve their organization’s security posture in response to  threat actors’ activity. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and  guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs. • Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  o Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used  and/or authorized software. • Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent  caching of password hashes locally. Timely patching is  one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize  its exposure to cybersecurity threats.

Guide to Securing Remote Access Software,2023-06-06,2,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 32, 'malware': 3}","Phishing  T1566  Threat actors have used phishing campaigns to lead victims to download  legitimate RMM software. • Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise users’ awareness of the risks  of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening suspicious attachments  [CPG 2 .I]. In this  way, remote access software has become a common, high-value instrument for cyber threat actors, especially  ransomware groups. As such, remote access software— and RMM in  particular—is often used by cybercriminals in ransomware incidents, and in certain APT campaigns. Cyber threat actors are increasingly co-opting these same tools for easy  and broad access to victim systems. This type of intrusion falls into the category of living off the land (LOTL) attacks, where inherently  malicious files, codes, and scripts are unnecessary, and cyber threat actors use tools already present in the  environment to sustain their malicious activity. This enables MSPs or IT help desks to monitor multiple devices and networks  at once, however these same features also make managing multiple intrusions easier for cyber threat actors. Remote access software is particularly appealing to threat actors because the software:  • Does not always trigger security tools. Remote access software enables cyber threat  actors to avoid using or developing custom malware, such as remote access trojans (RATs). The way remote  access products are legitimately used by network administrators is similar to how malicious RATs are used  by threat actors. Threat actors can leverage a portable  executable with local user rights to attack other vulnerable machines within the local intranet or  establish long-term persistent access as a local user service. This could allow a threat actor to download files that  would typically be detected and blocked at the firewall. Remote access software enables threat actors to manage multiple  intrusions at once. In addition, initial access brokers may sell network access to many different  cybercriminals, enabling multiple intrusions to the same network, as well as expanding the reach and ability  of these cyber threat actors. ASSOCIATED TTPS  Cyber threat actors use remote access software for initial access, maintaining persistence, deploying additional  software and tools, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Threat actors may also obtain legitimate, compromised remote access software credentials that ultimately enable  them to exercise control over remote endpoints associated with the compromised account. Once initial access is  obtained threat actors often use PowerShell or similar command line tools to silently deploy the RMM agent. Often,  threat actors leverage multiple RMM mechanisms at once. Threat actors use remote access software to perform multiple functions and carry out several commonly  associated TTPs (e.g .

COMMAND AND CONTROL  Technique Title  ID  Use  Remote Access  Software  T1219  Threat actors may establish command and control channels using  legitimate remote access software. Remote access software that may be leveraged by cyber threat actors includes, among others,  the following:    •  ConnectWise Control (formerly ScreenConnect)  •  Pulseway  • Anydesk  •  RemotePC  • Remote Utilities  •  Kaseya  • NetSupport  •  GoToMyPC  • Splashtop  •  N-Able  • Atera  •  Bomgar  • TeamViewer  •  Zoho Assist  •  LogMeIn      REPORTING  U.S. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing  cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,  techniques, and procedures. Additionally, the authoring agencies recommend developers:  • Incorporate threat modeling into their development processes to identify potential vulnerabilities. • Use advanced monitoring and incident response capabilities, which help to operationalize OT/ ICS threat detection and response for cybersecurity teams lacking expertise/infrastructure or budget to deploy full on-prem OT-specific cyber threat monitoring and management programs. Remote access software is often used for legitimate purposes, so it  generally blends into the environment and does not trigger antivirus (AV), antimalware, or endpoint  detection and response (EDR) defenses. Sometimes malicious actors also use RMM software in  concert with commercial penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike or remote access malware to enable  multiple, often redundant, forms of access to ensure persistence."
"North Korea Using Social Engineering to Enable Hacking of Think Tanks, Academia, and Media",2023-06-01,2,"{'phishing': 22, 'threats_of_violence': 5, 'malware': 6}","These North Korean cyber actors are known to conduct spearphishing campaigns  posing as real journalists, academics, or other individuals with credible links to North Korean policy  circles. Further, successful compromises enable Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective  spearphishing emails that can be leveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets. The  authoring agencies believe that raising awareness of some of these campaigns and employing basic  cyber security practices may frustrate the effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. Among social engineering techniques, Kimsuky actors  use spearphishing—or the use of fabricated emails and digital communications tailored to deceive a  target—as one of their primary vectors for initiating a compromise and gaining access into a target’s  devices and networks. For over a decade, Kimsuky actors have continued to refine their social  engineering techniques and made their spearphishing efforts increasingly difficult to discern. A Kimsuky spearphishing  campaign begins with  broad research and  preparation. The Kimsuky actors will  create email addresses  that resemble email  addresses of real  individuals they seek to  impersonate and generate  domains that host the  malicious content of a spearphishing message. They craft convincing spearphishing emails by repurposing the person’s email signature,  contact list, and past email exchanges. DPRK cyber actors are also known to compromise                        Sample of a program for generating DPRK spearphishing emails.   The initial phishing email occasionally contains a malicious link or document, often purporting  to be a report or news article. However, more often, the initial spearphishing email does not contain any  malicious links or attachments and is instead intended to gain the trust of the victim. Notably, victim responses to spearphishing lures also provide Pyongyang with the added benefit of  insight into foreign policy circles.   Actors are persistent if the target does not respond to the initial spearphishing email. The following are examples of real Kimsuky spearphishing attempts that illustrate variations of the  common themes. Impersonation of academic scholars  Kimsuky actors impersonate South Korean academic scholars to send spearphishing emails to  researchers at think tanks. Impersonation of think tank researchers  Kimsuky actors impersonate researchers from legitimate South Korean think tanks to send  spearphishing emails to political and North Korean experts. The link leads to a phishing site that mimics a legitimate web  portal login page where victims are directed to input personal information, including their usernames  and passwords, for harvesting by DPRK cyber actors. For potential recipients’ systems administrators:    Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users  about the risks of visiting websites, clicking on links, and opening attachments. Reinforce the  appropriate user response to phishing and spearphishing emails.   Require phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for as many services as  possible—particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access  critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed  operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require phishing-resistant  MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse.   Enabling DMARC and DKIM on email domains generally makes certain forms of email  spoofing more difficult, though it may not directly mitigate the tactics described above. We assess the primary goals of the DPRK regime’s cyber program include maintaining consistent  access to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea, and other countries of interest to  impede any political, military, or economic threat to the regime’s security and stability. Some targeted entities may discount the threat posed by these social engineering campaigns, either  because they do not perceive their research and communications as sensitive in nature, or because  they are not aware of how these efforts fuel the regime’s broader cyber espionage efforts. Although all DPRK advanced persistent threat groups employ social engineering techniques, the  campaigns and themes described in this advisory are specific to Kimsuky. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take  to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Compromise of a target account can lead  to persistent access to a victim’s communications, often through a malware used by Kimsuky  actors called BabyShark. The domains also may be identified as such in open-source  malware repositories like Virus Total. In many instances, Kimsuky actors do not attach malware to their initial email. Even after stealing the account information of their victims and infecting their  devices with malware, they sometimes continue to send “thank you” emails to their targets.   Install and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software on all hosts."

Initial Access Vector: Phishing  •  Implement a cybersecurity user awareness and  training program that includes guidance on how to  identify and report suspicious activity (e.g., phishing) or  incidents [CPG 2.I]. CISA offers a no-cost Phishing  Campaign Assessment and other  no-cost assessments. For example, OneNote attachments with embedded  malware have recently been used in phishing campaigns. This fully  managed security service prevents IT  systems from connecting to harmful web  domains and protects against cyber threats,  including:  • Malware,  • Ransomware, and   • Phishing. These  security services analyze DNS queries  and take action to mitigate threats— such as malware, ransomware, phishing  attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and  spyware—leveraging the existing DNS  protocol and architecture. These links then lead unsuspecting  users to phishing sites, malware downloads,  and other cyber threats. Users may visit these sites by  responding to a phishing email or by clicking  on a deceptive pop-up window. • Email addresses used by the attackers and any  associated phishing emails. Securing networks and other information sources from  continued credential-based unauthorized access may include:  Upon voluntary request, CISA and MS-ISAC  (for SLTT organizations) can assist with  analysis of phishing emails, storage media,  logs, and/or malware at no cost to help  organizations understand the root cause of  an incident. • Phishing email, storage media, log, and malware analysis based on voluntary submission. The application of both tactics is  known as “double extortion.” In some cases,  malicious actors may exfiltrate data and  threaten to release it as their sole form of  extortion without employing ransomware. The economic and  reputational impacts of ransomware and data  extortion have proven challenging and costly for  organizations of all sizes throughout the initial  disruption and, at times, extended recovery. This guide includes two  primary resources:  •  Part 1: Ransomware and Data Extortion Prevention Best Practices  •  Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist  Part 1 provides guidance for all organizations to reduce the impact and likelihood of ransomware  incidents and data extortion, including best practices to prepare for, prevent, and mitigate these  incidents. These ransomware and data extortion prevention and response best practices and recommendations  are based on operational insight from CISA, MS-ISAC, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations. Preparing for Ransomware and Data Extortion Incidents  Refer to the best practices and references listed in this section to help manage the risks posed by  ransomware and to drive a coordinated and efficient response for your organization in the event of an  incident. •  Create, maintain, and regularly exercise a basic cyber incident response plan (IRP) and  associated communications plan that includes response and notification procedures for  ransomware and data extortion/breach incidents [CPG 2.S]. Prevention best practices are grouped by common initial  access vectors of ransomware and data extortion actors. Part 2: Ransomware and Data Extortion Response Checklist  Should your organization be a victim of  ransomware, follow your approved IRP. These ransomware and associated data breach  incidents can severely impact business  processes by leaving organizations unable to  access necessary data to operate and deliver  mission-critical services. o Ensure that data breach notification procedures adhere to applicable state laws. Refer to  the National Conference of State Legislatures: Security Breach Notification Laws for  information on each state’s data breach notification laws and consult legal counsel when  necessary. If the incident resulted in a data breach, follow notification requirements as outlined in  your cyber incident response and communications plans. Over time, malicious  actors have adjusted their ransomware tactics to  be more destructive and impactful and have  also exfiltrated victim data and pressured  victims to pay by threatening to release the  stolen data. This guide is an update to the Joint  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency (CISA) and Multi-State Information  Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)  Ransomware Guide released in September  2020 (see What’s New) and was developed  through the JRTF. Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF). The JRTF, co-chaired by CISA and FBI, is an  interagency, collaborative effort to combat the  growing threat of ransomware attacks. The JRTF  was launched in response to a series of high- profile ransomware attacks on U.S. Government's response to ransomware  attacks and facilitates information sharing  and collaboration between government  agencies and private sector partners. •  Ensures operational coordination for activities  such as developing and sharing best  practices for preventing and responding to  ransomware attacks, conducting joint  investigations and operations against  ransomware threat actors, and providing  guidance and resources to organizations that  have been victimized by ransomware. •  Represents a significant step forward in  enabling unity of effort across the U.S  Government's efforts to address the growing  threat of ransomware attacks. Engaging with peer organizations and CISA enables your organization to receive critical and timely  information and access to services for managing ransomware and other cyber threats. What’s New  Since the initial release of the Ransomware Guide in September 2020, ransomware actors have  accelerated their tactics and techniques. •  Incorporated the #StopRansomware effort into  the title. •  Expanded the ransomware response checklist with threat hunting tips for detection and  analysis. #StopRansomware is CISA and FBI’s effort  to publish advisories for network defenders  that detail network defense information  related to various ransomware variants and  threat actors. It is  important that backups are maintained offline, as many  ransomware variants attempt to find and subsequently  delete or encrypt accessible backups to make  restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid. o Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response  Checklist in this guide and Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook to:    Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response. These  macros can be used to deliver ransomware [CPG 2.N]. This  enables detection of both “precursor”  malware and ransomware. o A ransomware infection may be  evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of  existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet. o In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is  dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email  compromise (BEC). •  Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect command and control  activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware  deployment. MSPs have been an  infection vector for ransomware  impacting numerous client  organizations [CPG 1.I]. Malicious actors often leverage privileged  accounts for network-wide ransomware attacks. Emerging ransomware strategies have  begun targeting VMware ESXi servers, hypervisors, and other centralized tools and systems,  which enables fast encryption of the infrastructure at scale. For more information about  ransomware resilience and hardening of VMware and other virtualization infrastructure, see: o NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server- based Hypervisor Platforms o VMware: Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening • Leverage best practices and enable security settings in association with cloud  environments, such as Microsoft Office 365. o Enable delete protection or object lock on storage resources often targeted in  ransomware attacks (e.g., object storage, database storage, file storage, and block  storage) to prevent data from being deleted or overwritten, respectively. Threat actors use PowerShell to deploy  ransomware and hide their malicious activities. Malicious actors often target and use DCs as a staging  point to spread ransomware network wide. Detection and Analysis  Refer to the best practices and references  below to help manage the risk posed by  ransomware and support your organization’s  coordinated and efficient response to a  ransomware incident. Additionally, paying ransoms may pose sanctions  risks. Department of the Treasury Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) memorandum from  September 2021, Updated Advisory on Potential  Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware  Payments. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their  access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline. Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid  further spread of the ransomware infection. Note: This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts  and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. Misuse of these tools is a  common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery. Reporting and Notification  Note: Refer to the Contact Information  section at the end of this guide for details on  how to report and notify about ransomware  incidents. Consult federal law enforcement, even if mitigation actions are possible, regarding  possible decryptors available, as security researchers may have discovered encryption flaws  for some ransomware variants and released decryption or other types of tools. Government,  MS-ISAC, or a reputable security vendor) for the particular ransomware variant and follow any  additional recommended steps to identify and contain systems or networks that are confirmed to  be impacted. The designated IT or IT security authority declares the ransomware incident over  based on established criteria, which may include taking the steps above or seeking outside  assistance. What You Can Expect:  • Specific guidance to help evaluate and remediate ransomware incidents. • Remote assistance to identify the extent of the compromise and recommendations for appropriate containment and mitigation strategies (dependent on specific ransomware variant). This  includes best practices and network defense information regarding ransomware trends and  variants as well as malware that is a precursor to ransomware. CSET includes the  Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA), a self-assessment based on a tiered set of  practices to help organizations evaluate how well they are equipped to defend and recover from  a ransomware incident. •  Security Primer – Ransomware (MS-ISAC)—outlines opportunistic and strategic ransomware  campaigns, common infection vectors, and best practice recommendations. •  Institute for Security + Technology (IST) Blueprint for Ransomware Defense—an action plan for  ransomware mitigation, response, and recovery for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The authoring organizations recommend that organizations take the following initial steps to prepare  and protect their facilities, personnel, and customers from cyber and physical security threats and other  hazards:  •  Join a sector-based information sharing and analysis center (ISAC), where eligible, such as:  o MS-ISAC for U.S. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on  existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful  threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly  secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using  compromised credentials.   PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry  interaction and possible tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor’s  PowerShell use. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and  then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further  extort the victim and pressure them into paying. Common tools for data  exfiltration include Rclone, Rsync, various web-based file storage services (also  used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on the affected network), and  FTP/SFTP. PURPOSE  This document was developed in furtherance of the authors’ cybersecurity missions, including their  responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and to develop and issue cybersecurity  specifications and mitigations. Malicious actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations, so then harden SMBv3:  o Block or limit internal SMB traffic to systems that require access. •  Enable common attachment filters to restrict file types that commonly contain malware  and should not be sent by email. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s post Anti-malware  protection in EOP. o Malware is often compressed in password protected archives that evade antivirus  scanning and email filters. •  Monitor indicators of activity and block malware file creation with the Windows Sysmon  utility. •  Consider implementing sandboxed  browsers to protect systems from  malware originating from web browsing. Malicious  actors use drive-by downloads to steal and  collect personal information, inject trojans, or  introduce exploit kits or other malware to  endpoints. • “Malvertising”: malicious advertising that  cybercriminals use to inject malware to users’  computers when they visit malicious  websites or click an online advertisement. Malvertising may also direct users to a  corrupted website where their data can be  stolen, or malware can be downloaded onto  their computer.   The authoring organizations recommend using Windows Server 2019 or greater  and Windows 10 or greater as they have security features, such as LSASS  protections with Windows Credential Guard, Windows Defender, and  Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), not included in older operating system  o Ensure that DCs are regularly patched. Doing so can highlight evidence of additional  systems or malware involved in earlier stages of the attack. □ Look for evidence of precursor “dropper” malware, such as Bumblebee, Dridex, Emotet,  QakBot, or Anchor.   Operators of these advanced malware variants will often sell access to a  network. Care must be taken to identify such dropper malware before rebuilding  from backups to prevent continuing compromises. • Names of malware identified on your network. Collect any  relevant logs as well as samples of any  “precursor” malware binaries and associated  observables or indicators of compromise  (e.g., suspected command and control IP  addresses, suspicious registry entries, or  other relevant files detected). • Assistance in conducting a criminal investigation, which may involve collecting incident artifacts, including system images and malware samples."

The LockBit 3.0 ransomware operations function as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and is  a continuation of previous versions of the ransomware, LockBit 2.0, and LockBit. The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. CAPABILITIES  LockBit 3.0, also known as “LockBit Black,” is more modular and evasive than its previous versions  and shares similarities with Blackmatter and Blackcat ransomware. LockBit 3.0 is configured upon compilation with many different options that determine the behavior of  the ransomware. Upon the actual execution of the ransomware within a victim environment, various  arguments can be supplied to further modify the behavior of the ransomware. If a LockBit affiliate  does not have access to passwordless LockBit 3.0 ransomware, then a password argument is  mandatory during the execution of the ransomware. LockBit 3.0 affiliates failing to enter the correct  password will be unable to execute the ransomware [T1480.001].

Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server,2023-03-15,1,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 24, 'malware': 6}","Other Best Practice Mitigation Recommendations  •  Implement phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for as many services  possible—particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access  critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. TLP:CLEAR  Product ID: AA23-074A March 15, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR  Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik  Vulnerability in U.S. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors,  including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET  deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in  Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET  AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet  Information Services (IIS) web server. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding detection and mitigation recommendations. Overview  CISA and authoring organizations assess that, beginning as late as November 2022, threat actors  successfully exploited a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in an instance of Telerik  UI for ASP.NET AJAX Q2 2013 SP1 (version 2013.2.717) running on an FCEB agency’s Microsoft IIS  server. This exploit, which results in interactive access with the web server, enabled the threat actors  to successfully execute remote code on the vulnerable web server. Analysis suggests that cyber threat actors exploited CVE-2019-18935 in conjunction with either CVE- 2017-11357 or CVE-2017-11317. Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Advisory 2020-004  assesses that exploitation of CVE-2019-18935 is only possible with knowledge of Telerik  RadAsyncUpload encryption keys.[2] Threat actors can obtain these keys through either prior  knowledge or exploitation of vulnerabilities—CVE-2017-11357 or CVE-2017-11317—present in older,  unpatched versions of Telerik released between 2007 and 2017. Threat Actor Activity  CISA and authoring organizations observed multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor— hereafter referred to as Threat Actor 1 (TA1)—and known cybercriminal actor XE Group—hereafter  referred to as Threat Actor 2 (TA2)—conducting reconnaissance and scanning activities [T1595.002]  that correlate to the successful exploitation of CVE-2019-18935 in the agency’s IIS server running  Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX [T1190]. When exploiting the vulnerability, the threat actors uploaded malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) files  (some masqueraded as portable network graphics [PNG] files) [T1105] to the C:\Windows\Temp\  directory. CISA and authoring organizations confirmed that some malicious files dropped on the IIS server are  consistent with a previously reported file naming convention that threat actors commonly use when  exploiting CVE-2019-18935.[3] The threat actors name the files in the Unix Epoch time format and  use the date and time as recorded on the target system. The uncorrelated Unix Epoch time format may  indicate that the threat actors used the timestomping [T1070.006] technique. This file naming  convention is a primary IOC used by the threat actors. In many cases, malicious artifacts were not available for analysis because the threat actors’  malware—that looks for and removes files with the .dll file extension—removed files [T1070.004] from  the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory. CISA and authoring organizations observed error messages  being sent to the threat actors’ command and control (C2) server when permission restraints  prevented the service account from executing the malicious DLLs and writing new files. Threat Actor 1  CISA and authoring organizations observed TA1 exploiting CVE-2019-18935 for system enumeration  beginning in August 2022. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to upload malicious DLLs on a target  system and execute them by abusing a legitimate process, e.g., the w3wp.exe process. Volexity lists this naming convention and other observed  TTPs as common for this threat actor group.[4]  As early as August 2021, CISA and authoring organizations observed TA2 delivering malicious PNG  files that, following analysis, were masqueraded DLL files to avoid detection [T1036.005]. Note: It is likely the threat actors changed the file extension from .dll  to .png to avoid detection. •  The C2 server may send the command xequit, causing the malware to sleep for a period  of time determined by the threat actors. MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES  See Table 4 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to  protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Proper network segmentation significantly reduces the ability for threat actor  lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Instead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to  directly interact with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Once on the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated  antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001]. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance  Goals (CPGs), which provide a minimum set of practices and protections that are informed by the  most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and which yield goals that  all organizations across critical infrastructure sectors should implement:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers [CPG 7.3] in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e.,  hard drive, storage device, the cloud). Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally."

ESXiArgs Ransomware Virtual Machine Recovery Guidance,2023-02-08,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'ransomware': 15, 'threats_of_violence': 3, 'malware': 4}","•  Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible [CPG 1.3]—particularly for  webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage  backups. •  Implement user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users  about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening  suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and  spearphishing emails. TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-039A February 8, 2023 TLP:CLEAR Co-Authored by:  ESXiArgs Ransomware Virtual Machine  Recovery Guidance  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware  campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware  ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware  ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts  configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt to  recover their files. If malicious actors have compromised your organization with ESXiArgs ransomware, CISA and FBI  recommend following the script and guidance provided in this CSA to attempt to recover access to  your files. The actors are likely  targeting end-of-life ESXi servers or ESXi servers that do not have the available ESXi software  patches applied.[1]   ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts certain configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering VMs  unusable. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. CISA is aware that some organizations have reported  success in recovering files without paying ransoms. In addition, CISA and FBI recommend organizations apply the following recommendations to prepare  for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. Preparing for Ransomware  •  Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration [CPG 7.3]. These  practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential  downtime from a ransomware incident and protect against data losses. •  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated  communications plan that includes response procedures for a ransomware incident [CPG  7.1, 7.2]. Responding to Ransomware Incidents  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:  •  Follow your organization’s Ransomware Response Checklist (see Preparing for Ransomware  section). Note: CISA and FBI strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and  records will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and  TTPs identified through FBI and ASD’S ACSC investigations. (New, November 20, 2024) The reporting agencies are aware of multiple ransomware groups, like  BianLian, that seek to misattribute location and nationality by choosing foreign-language names, almost  May 16, 2023 Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from BianLian data  extortion:    Strictly limit the use of RDP and  other remote desktop services. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data  extortion cybercriminal group, likely based in Russia, with multiple Russia-based affiliates. FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small- and medium-sized  organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the  likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware and data extortion incidents. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group. BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in  which they exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files for leverage and encrypted  victims’ systems. In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift primarily to exfiltration-based extortion with victims’  systems left intact, and ASD’S ACSC observed BianLian shift exclusively to exfiltration-based extortion. Exfiltration and Impact  BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See Appendix: Windows  PowerShell and Command Shell Activity) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023,  BianLian actors encrypted files [T1486] after exfiltration for double extortion.

In addition, FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to  limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:    Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data  and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage  device, or the cloud). We got proofs that  your data was kept with a number of data security violations of data breach  laws. If this leak will take  place they will have to monitor their credit history and identity theft for next  3 years. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to  help organizations protect against ransomware. (See Figure 1 for a legacy  ransomware note). Figure 1: BianLian Sample Legacy Ransom Note (Look at this instruction.txt)  (New, November 20, 2024) Newer ransomware notes state BianLian group has exfiltrated data and  threaten to leak the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool.

People's Republic of China-Linked Actors Compromise Routers and IoT Devices for Botnet Operations,2024-09-18,3,"{'threats_of_violence': 4, 'botnet': 27, 'malware': 8}","FBI, CNMF, NSA, and allied partners are releasing this Joint Cyber Security Advisory to highlight the threat  posed by these actors and their botnet activity and to encourage exposed device vendors, owners, and  operators to update and secure their devices from being compromised and joining the botnet. victims of these computer intrusions and found activity  consistent with the tactics, techniques, and infrastructure associated with the cyber threat group known  publicly as Flax Typhoon, RedJuliett, and Ethereal Panda. Botnet Command and Control  As with similar botnets, this botnet infrastructure is comprised of a network of devices, known as “bots,”  which are infected with a type of malware that provides threat actors with unauthorized remote access. Routers and IoT devices may provide features such as Universal Plug and Play (UPnP),  remote management options, and file sharing services, which threat actors may abuse to gain  initial access or to spread malware to other networked devices. Product ID: JCSA-20240918-001 September 18, 2024  TLP:CLEAR     People’s Republic of China-Linked Actors  Compromise Routers and IoT Devices for  Botnet Operations  Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), and National Security  Agency (NSA) assess that People’s Republic of China (PRC)-linked cyber actors have compromised  thousands of Internet-connected devices, including small office/home office (SOHO) routers, firewalls,  network-attached storage (NAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the goal of creating a network of  compromised nodes (a “botnet”) positioned for malicious activity. The actors may then use the botnet as a  proxy to conceal their identities while deploying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or  compromising targeted U.S. Integrity Technology Group (Integrity Tech), a PRC-based company, has controlled and managed a botnet  active since mid-2021. The botnet has regularly maintained between tens to hundreds of thousands of  compromised devices. As of June 2024, the botnet consisted of over 260,000 devices. Victim devices  which are part of the botnet have been observed in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,  Southeast Asia and Australia. While devices aged beyond their end-of-life dates are known to be more vulnerable to intrusion, many of the  compromised devices in the Integrity Tech-controlled botnet are likely still supported by their respective vendors. Network  defenders are advised to follow the guidance in the mitigations section to protect against the PRC-linked  cyber actors’ botnet activity. Cyber security companies can also leverage the information in this advisory to  assist with identifying malicious activity and reducing the number of devices present in botnets worldwide. Integrity Tech has used  China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses to control and manage the botnet described in this  advisory. In addition to managing the botnet, these same China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses were  used to access other operational infrastructure employed in computer intrusion activities against U.S. A  functioning botnet can be used for a variety of purposes, including malware delivery, distributed denial of  service (DDoS) attacks, or routing nefarious Internet traffic. The botnet uses the Mirai family of malware, designed to hijack IoT devices such as webcams, DVRs, IP  cameras, and routers running Linux-based operating systems. The Mirai source code was posted publicly  on the Internet in 2016, resulting in other hackers creating their own botnets based on the malware. Since  that time, various Mirai botnets have been used to conduct DDoS and other malicious activities against  victim entities within the U.S. The investigated botnet’s customized Mirai malware is a component of a system that automates the  compromise of a variety of devices. To recruit a new “bot,” the botnet system first compromises an  Internet-connected device using one of a variety of known vulnerability exploits (see Appendix B: Observed  CVEs). These  management servers host a MySQL database which stored information used for the control of the botnet. The management servers hosted an application known as “Sparrow,” which allows users to interact with  the botnet. The code for the Sparrow application, stored within a Git repository, defines functions that allow registered  users to manage and control the botnet and C2 servers, sending tasks to victim devices including DDoS  and exploitation commands to grow the botnet. A subcomponent called “vulnerability arsenal” also allows users to  exploit traditional computer networks through the victim devices in the botnet. Compromised Device Distribution  The following tables approximate the count of devices compromised by the botnet system as of June 2024,  by location and by processor architecture. There were at least 50 different Linux operating system versions  found among botnet nodes. The following guidance applies both to  preventing IoT devices from becoming part of a botnet, as well as to defending networks from botnets  already in operation. Since DDoS attacks originating from botnets may at first  appear similar to normal traffic, it is critical for organizations to define, monitor and prepare for  abnormal traffic volumes. Post-compromise, the victim device executes a Mirai-based malware payload from a remote server. Some  malware payloads were self-deleting to evade detection."

Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations,2024-08-28,3,"{'ransomware': 15, 'threats_of_violence': 10, 'malware': 2}","TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA24-241A August 28, 2024  TLP:CLEAR Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling  Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations  Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to  warn network defenders that, as of August 2024, a group of Iran-based cyber actors continues to exploit  U.S. The FBI assesses a significant  percentage of these threat actors’ operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop  network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further  assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and—separate  from the ransomware activity—conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such  as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan). A significant percentage of the group’s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of  obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to  enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have  collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[3], Ransomhouse[4], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat)  (#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat). The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based  location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence  victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously  referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and  organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group’s  ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. However, the group’s ransomware activities are likely not  sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency  movement associated with their malicious activity. Exfiltration and Impact  After infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape,  Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by  providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort  victims [T1657].

Best practices for event logging and threat detection 4  Introduction The increased prevalence of malicious actors employing LOTL techniques, such as LOTL binaries  (LOLBins) and fileless malware, highlights the importance of implementing and maintaining an  effective event logging solution. As demonstrated in the joint-sealed publication Identifying and  Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are employing LOTL  techniques to evade detection. The purpose of this publication is to detail best practice guidance  for event logging and threat detection for cloud services, enterprise networks, enterprise mobility,  and operational technology (OT) networks. In the context of cyber security incident response and threat detection, event log quality refers to  the types of events collected rather than how well a log is formatted.

To detect threats on endpoints such as user devices, organisations should consider implementing  an endpoint detection and response solution. By following the guidance in this publication to improve the collection and centralisation of event logs,  it will improve an organisation’s ability to undertake effective threat hunting to proactively investigate  LOTL compromises.

Their campaign has been enabled by privately-owned SOHO routers,  infected with the ‘KV Botnet’ malware. When assessing the risks to a system,  consider that in some cases, it can take up to 18 months to discover a cyber security incident and some  malware can dwell on the network from 70 to 200 days before causing overt harm.3 Log retention  periods should also be compliant with any regulatory requirements and cyber security frameworks  that may apply in an organisation’s jurisdiction. These include malware, malicious insiders,  and exploitation of unpatched applications and services. For example,  malicious actors can access OT networks through IT networks by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities,  delivering malware, or conducting denial-of-service campaigns to impact critical services. While Volt Typhoon uses LOTL techniques to make detection more difficult, the behaviours that the  malware exhibits would be considered abnormal compared to business-as-usual activity and could be  used to create detection use cases."
#StopRansomware: BlackSuit (Royal) Ransomware,2024-08-07,3,"{'phishing': 9, 'extortion': 3, 'non_payment_non_delivery': 1, 'ransomware': 24, 'threats_of_violence': 21, 'malware': 2}","• Train users to recognize and report phishing  attempts. Phishing emails are among the most successful  vectors for initial access by BlackSuit threat actors. According to third-party reporting, BlackSuit actors most commonly gain initial access to  victim networks via phishing emails [T1566]. o According to open source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that delivers  BlackSuit ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF documents  [T1566.001] and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Phishing  T1566  BlackSuit actors most commonly gain initial access to victim  networks via phishing. Phishing: Spear  phishing Attachment  T1566.001  BlackSuit actors used malicious PDF document attachments in  phishing campaigns. Phishing: Spear  phishing Link  T1566.002  The actors gain initial access using malvertising links via emails and  public-facing sites.   Require Phishing-Resistant multifactor authentication to administrator accounts [CPG 2.H], and  require standard MFA for all services to the extent possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private  networks, and accounts that access critical systems.   Mandate MFA, ideally phishing-resistant MFA, for privileged users and make MFA a default, rather  than opt-in, feature. (Updated August 7, 2024) BlackSuit conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to encryption and then  publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption percentage  for larger files, which helps evade detection, and also significantly improves ransomware speed.[1] In  addition to encrypting files, BlackSuit actors also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten  to publicly release the exfiltrated data if the victim does not pay the ransom. Extortioner named  BlackSuit has attacked your system. BlackSuit uses a leak site to publish victim data based on non-payment. Product ID: AA23-061A March 2, 2023 TLP: CLEAR TLP:CLEAR #StopRansomware: BlackSuit (Royal)  Ransomware  Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail  various ransomware variants and ransomware  threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators  of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect  against ransomware.   August 7, 2024: The advisory was updated to notify network defenders of the rebrand of “Royal”  ransomware actors to “BlackSuit.” The update includes new TTPs, IOCs, and detection methods  related to BlackSuit ransomware. (New August 7, 2024) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate known BlackSuit ransomware IOCs  • Prioritize remediating known exploited  vulnerabilities. BlackSuit ransomware is the evolution of the ransomware previously identified as Royal  ransomware, which was used from approximately September 2022 through June 2023. BlackSuit shares  numerous coding similarities with Royal ransomware and has exhibited improved capabilities. After gaining access to victims’ networks, BlackSuit  actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the  ransomware and encrypting the systems. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Ransomware operators often use  open source projects to aid their intrusion activities. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. BlackSuit actors have been  observed using legitimate software and open source tools during ransomware operations. Indicators of Compromise (IOC)  See Table 1 through Table 5 for Royal ransomware IOCs obtained by FBI during threat response activities  as of January 2023. (New November 13, 2023) See Table 6 and Table 7 for Royal and BlackSuit Ransomware IOCs as of June  2023. (New August 7, 2024) See Table 9 through Table 15 for BlackSuit ransomware IOCs obtained by FBI during  threat response activities as of July 2024 and Figure 1 for a sample ransom note.   Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 3.A]. To aid in detecting the ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a  network.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Note: The joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices  as well as a ransomware response checklist.   No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Ransom amounts are not part of the initial ransom note, but  require direct interaction with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser)  provided after encryption. See the MITRE ATT&CK  Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics  and techniques. Initial Access  BlackSuit uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a specific  percentage of data in a file to encrypt. Lateral Movement and Persistence  (Updated August 7, 2024) Historically, Royal threat actors used RDP and legitimate operating system (OS)  diagnostic tools to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. Once on the  domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus software [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy  Objects [T1484.001]. See Table 8 for a list of legitimate software used by Royal and BlackSuit threat actors identified  through FBI investigations as of June 2023. Threat actors have been observed using open source network tunneling tools  such as Chisel and Cloudflared, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) Client, OpenSSH, and MobaXterm to  establish SSH connections. BlackSuit Ransom Note  MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  See Table 18 through Table 23 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory, as  well as corresponding detection and/or mitigation recommendations.

Table 23: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Impact  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data Encrypted for Impact  T1486  BlackSuit actors encrypted data to determine which  files were being used or blocked by other  applications. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat actors are  not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise  framework in this advisory.

Commodity Malware and Dual-Use Applications  Commodity malware is malicious software widely available for purchase or use and is leveraged by  numerous different threat actors. Dual-use applications are software tools widely available for purchase or  use that are commonly utilized by administrators and users for system administration or other legitimate  purposes and also by threat actors for malicious activities. Acknowledgements   Mandiant and Microsoft Threat Intelligence contributed to this CSA. Purpose   This document was developed in furtherance of the authoring agencies’ cybersecurity missions, including  their responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and to develop and issue cybersecurity  specifications and mitigations. The actors deploy and leverage custom malware implants, remote access  tools (RATs), and open source tooling for execution, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. The use  of publicly available malware and dual-use applications enables the actors to conceal and obfuscate their  identities and leads to attribution problems. The authoring agencies are reliant on the use of custom  malware and loaders, along with overlapping C2 nodes to attribute commodity malware to the actors. The  actors have at times achieved great success obfuscating their identities by leveraging open source  malware or dual-use applications. The typos also illustrate a poor  grasp of the English language, including common errors such as “Microsoft Cooperation” (rather than  “Microsoft Corporation”) found across numerous RGB 3rd Bureau malware samples. The actors disguise their malware within HTTP packets to appear as benign  network traffic.

2024 U.S. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat,2024-06-28,2,"{'extortion': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 35}","•  Adversaries may attempt to blackmail or coerce an insider to leverage the insider’s access, collect insights on  election security efforts and vulnerabilities, or direct the insider to perform malicious activity. Prior to initiating  contact, the foreign adversaries likely would collect information on the target to uncover anything they could use  for blackmail or coercion. Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) prepared this overview to help partners defend against insider threat concerns that could  materialize during the 2024 election cycle. For years, federal, state, local, and private sector partners nationwide have  worked closely together to support state and local officials in safeguarding election infrastructure from cyber, physical,  and insider threats. Over the past several years, the election infrastructure community  has experienced multiple instances of election system access control compromises conducted by insider threats. While  there is no evidence that malicious actors impacted election outcomes, it is important that election stakeholders at all  levels are aware of the risks posed by insider threats and the steps that they can take to identify and mitigate these  threats. This document outlines several recent examples of election security-related insider threats, discusses potential scenarios  that could arise during the 2024 election cycle, and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the risk posed by  insider threats.1  Insider Threats to Elections  In the United States, elections are administered at the state and local levels of government, which has resulted in a  diverse landscape of election systems and technologies across the country. Understanding what  constitutes insider status and how insiders can present risks to an organization are important components of developing  a comprehensive insider threat mitigation program. An insider threat can be an individual or group who uses their authorized access or special knowledge to cause harm to  an organization or entity. Insider threats could manifest as current or former employees, temporary workers, volunteers,  contractors, or any other individuals with privileged access to election systems and information. Recent Examples of Election Infrastructure-related Insider Threats  •  A temporary election worker inserted an unauthorized personal flash drive into an electronic poll book containing  voter registration data, including confidential information barred from release under state law. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat          2 Commercial Routing Assistance  2024 U.S. Potential for Foreign Adversary Exploitation of Insider Threats  To date, the examples of insider threat activity related to the elections process have been domestic in nature, both in  terms of the actor and the motivations. While we assess that the  threat of  a foreign adversary gaining access to election infrastructure through a witting insider is minimal, the perceived  normalization (or steady-state) of election influence or interference might help drive some adversaries to push the  boundaries of U.S. One way this foreign derived threat could manifest is via attempts to exploit insider access to interfere with  election infrastructure or processes. Potential Indicators of Insider Threat Activity  Individuals at risk of becoming insider threats often exhibit warning signs, or indicators.2 The following list is not all  inclusive, but contains potential flags that election officials should be alert to and seek further review by authorities:  •  Attempting to alter or destroy ballots, mail-in ballot envelopes, administrative documentation, or allowing others  to access these materials without prior approval. •  Intimidating or threatening other staff. Securing Your Organization: Building an Insider Threat Mitigation Program  Election workers and their private sector partners regularly employ practices designed to deter, detect, or prevent harmful  acts by insiders, whether or not they use the term “insider threat” or have articulated their approach and practices in a  documented program. From handling ballots in teams of two (often bipartisan), to robust chain-of-custody procedures, to  the presence of observers during voting and ballot counting, many longstanding core election practices have been  designed with insider threat mitigation in mind. Nevertheless, election infrastructure stakeholders may benefit from  documenting their approach and establishing a more formalized insider threat mitigation program. From this foundation, a successful insider threat mitigation program should  implement practices, strategies, and systems that limit and track access across organizational functions. Provided they  receive the necessary oversight to ensure they are being applied appropriately, preventative measures against insider  threats also contribute to detecting threats by establishing transparent, auditable election systems and processes and  then identifying outliers or anomalies for investigation. Key elements of election infrastructure insider threat mitigation  programs include:  •  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) describe the sequence of steps or requirements to complete a task. This can help prevent unauthorized  access to sensitive systems, detect the presence of an insider threat, provide evidence, and improve remediation  time if an incident occurs. It produces an auditable record of an asset’s transfers and transactions, enabling  detection of a potential threat if there is a gap in the chain. •  Continuous Monitoring is a key practice for detecting anomalous behavior, to include potential insider threats. Cybersecurity best practices like multi-factor authentication, patching  and updating, and network segmentation all help minimize the potential security impact if an incident, like an  insider threat, were to occur. To assist stakeholders with their insider threat mitigation  efforts, CISA developed an “Insider Threat Reporting Template” and an “Insider Threat Investigation Template” as tools for  organizations to download, review, and incorporate into their insider threat mitigation programs. These templates and  “Insider Threat Reporting Templates User Guide” are annexes to this guide and can be found on the CISA #PROTECT2024  website and are linked below. The Reporting Form and the  Investigative Form are fillable PDFs that can be used with any insider threat program. The Reporting Form allows individuals to submit concerns related to a potential insider threat to the appropriate point of  contact within their organization. The Investigative Form is designed to help organizations document incidents and determine appropriate next steps,  including, but not limited to, review by an organization’s Threat Management Team, referral to law enforcement, or other  follow-on actions as necessary to protect the organization and its employees. This will assist stakeholders as they keep a  record of organizational actions related to an insider threat incident, promote accountability of necessary steps to protect  assets, and to identify vulnerabilities in the effort of mitigating future insider threats. If you have a concern about an immediate threat in the  workplace, contact your local law enforcement.

Additionally, if a data breach occurs due to user error or third-party vendors, an  organization cannot readily prove the origin of the issue without the aforementioned centralized  access to data identifying the user, application, and/or connection.[7]    Implement network segmentation. Through hijacking legitimate user sessions,  threat actors acquired elevated permissions to harvest credentials, move laterally, and access data  and resources.[3] Lockbit 3.0 affiliates exploited this vulnerability in ransomware attacks.[3]  Aside from exploiting vulnerabilities, threat actors can gain access to all services within an organization’s  network if they use a compromised device or account and connect through VPN services. CISA, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), New Zealand’s  Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-NZ), and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)  (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) urge business owners—regardless of size—to review  this report to better understand the vulnerabilities, threats, and practices associated with traditional  remote access and VPN deployment, along with the inherent business risk posed to an organization’s  network by remote access misconfiguration. Many VPN solutions are software based,  meaning the risk of cyber threat actors exploiting software vulnerabilities can become detrimental to  business operations. IMPACT  Vulnerabilities in VPN systems can lead to substantial impacts to organizations if exploited by threat actors  because they may enable easy access across a large enterprise network after successful exploitation of  the device. Multiple sources observed the Internet-facing ICS VPN appliance  fell victim to compromise when an attacker exploited configuration data to reverse tunnel from the  ICS VPN appliance.[1] Then, the attacker modified a JavaScript file used by the Web SSL VPN  component of the device to compromise credentials and move from system to system.[1] Memory  and disk forensics were used during forensic analysis, combined with the Integrity Checker Tool, to  identify malicious files on the compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliance.[2] However, this  tool and patching failed to detect the compromise due to threat actors going virtually undetected,  circumventing factory reset, and gaining root-level-access.[2]    CVE-2023-4966 (Citrix Bleed) affecting Citrix NetScaler web application delivery control (ADC) and  NetScaler Gateway appliances. This vulnerability allowed threat actors to bypass password  requirements and multifactor authentication (MFA), leading to successful hijacking of legitimate  user sessions on Citrix NetScaler web applications. By not exposing internal  applications to unnecessary risk, the organization can reduce the overall threat of compromise—further  securing data at rest. Adhering to ZT principles to any degree will  enhance your organization’s ability to secure information, keeping it safe from threats and data loss. Cloud Secure Web Gateway  Cloud Secure Web Gateway (SWG) is a security solution that protects users and devices from web-based  threats and enforces security policies within the network.

Mitigating Cyber Threats with Limited Resources: Guidance for Civil Society,2024-05-14,2,"{'phishing': 20, 'harassment_stalking': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 33, 'malware': 17}","To mitigate  state-sponsored actors performing reconnaissance  and gaining initial access to enterprise networks via  phishing and compromised credentials, prioritize  the following:  1) Keep software updated on user devices and IT infrastructure. 2) Implement phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) [CPG 2.H]. Set up phishing- resistant MFA makes it more difficult for actors to compromise user accounts, and often  make legitimate user sign-ins simpler at the same time. See CISA’s Phishing-Resistant  Multifactor Authentication guide for additional information. 9) Implement basic cybersecurity training to cover concepts such as account phishing, email  and web browsing security, and password security [CPG 2.I]. Threat actors also use phishing, a form of social engineering, to steal login credentials for initial  network access. State-sponsored actors invest substantial time and resources crafting identities for phishing  attempts, leading to meticulously tailored attempts (this is specifically known as “spearphishing”). Phishing for Information  T1598  Malicious actors send phishing messages to elicit  sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) that  can be used for future operations. Description of Known Initial Access Techniques: Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors use  credentials obtained via their phishing attempts (see the Reconnaissance section) to gain access to  networks. APT actors also leverage malware-based phishing to obtain initial access to targets. In malware- based phishing attacks, malicious actors pose as trustworthy sources to lure a victim into interacting  with a malicious hyperlink or opening an email attachment to execute malware on host systems. Note: Phishing is  often made easier by the prevalence of well-known weaknesses in software that actors exploit to  deliver their malware payloads. Examples: APT groups associated with Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia integrate spearphishing  emails into broader campaigns aimed at high-risk communities. Velvet Chollima’s spearphishing operations showcase a nuanced and targeted  cyber espionage strategy, employing social engineering and malicious  payloads to infiltrate and monitor the communications of high-value targets. 16 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Mustang Panda:  The group’s preferred initial intrusion vector is spearphishing emails, primarily  to deploy remote access Trojans.

This guide provides recommendations for civil society organizations and individuals to mitigate the  threat of state-sponsored cyber operations based on observed malicious behavior. 19       4 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Introduction  Industry reporting emphasizes the prevalence and global nature of cyber threats to civil society,  necessitating their preparedness against a diverse range of politically and ideologically motivated  threat actors. Civil society organizations are considered high-risk communities (HRC) due to their  high threat level and low defense capacity. Specifically:   •  Civil society organizations and their staff are at high threat of being targeted by malicious  cyber actors. Organizations with low defense capacity are ill-prepared for and vulnerable to common cyber  threats, such as social engineering attempts. Low defense capacity is exacerbated, in most cases, by products and services designed in a manner  that places the burden of reducing cyber threats on the customer or end user. This joint guide, developed as part of CISA’s High-Risk Community Protection (HRCP) initiative* and  NCSC-UK’s Defending Democracy campaign†, provides mitigation measures for civil society  organizations to reduce their risk based on common cyber threats. The authoring agencies also encourage software manufacturers to take  responsibility for their customers’ security outcomes by applying the mitigations in this advisory and  designing products that prevent the most common classes of attack by malicious actors.‡      * Established in 2023, CISA’s HRCP initiative serves as the enduring home for the agency’s work to identify and partner  with high-risk communities to understand the threats they face, identify the resources which can bolster their defense, and  close gaps in support. Through the NCSC’s Defending Democracy work, the NCSC is seeking to partner with high-risk public and  elected officials to advance understanding of the sophisticated threats targeting individuals across personal and enterprise  devices. 5 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Cyber Threats to Civil Society  The lack of reporting in threat telemetry and intelligence feeds, coupled with HRCs’ limited  accessibility to enterprise-level solutions, hinders commercial and government organizations’  accurate measurement of threats posed to HRCs. These cybersecurity  controls provide a minimum set of practices and  protections that are informed by the most common  and impactful threats and behaviors. • Informed by threats observed by CISA  and its government and industry  partners. To enhance personal and organizational  cybersecurity, comprehension of the specific threats and behaviors relevant to your industry  or self is essential. Establish a reference list that outlines potential threats, considering the  unique risk landscape associated with your work, interests, and organizations. This can  include industry-specific cyber threats, regulatory considerations, and historical attack  patterns. Without encryption, threat actors can  exploit unencrypted or unauthenticated channels to inject malware into user devices, posing  significant risks to privacy and security. o Use trusted app stores to avoid potential threats from malicious third-party applications. o Install updates promptly to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities by threat actors. 10 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Resources  See CISA’s Project Upskill for detailed guidance on how to improve your cybersecurity posture and  raise the cost, in terms of time and resources, for a threat actor to target you. According to CERTFA, a  Computer Emergency Response Team that specializes in tracking Iranian cyber threat actors,  Charming Kitten has been observed targeting “individuals, academics, journalists, activists,  think tanks, military and government sectors in the United States, Europe, and the Middle  East since as early as 2014.”12  Between August 2020 and May 2021, IBM X-Force  documented Charming Kitten’s successful compromise of multiple victims within the Iranian  reformist movement. The term advanced persistent threat (APT) is generally used for  well-resourced, state-sponsored groups that engage in sophisticated activity often targeted and aimed at prolonged  network/system intrusion. In these instances, the threat actors pose as trustworthy sources (e.g., colleagues,  acquaintances, or organizations) to lure victims into providing their login credentials—often by  entering the credentials in a threat actor-controlled site to capture them. 14 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR While predominantly executed via email, threat actors adapt their tactics to high-risk communities’  communication preferences, leveraging text messaging, social media platforms, and diverse digital  channels used for research and advocacy. Velvet Chollima:  Velvet Chollima threat actors have been observed posing as a journalist  seeking an interview or adopting the guise of an academic soliciting survey  participation. Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report 2023 reports APT threat activity against  think tanks, NGOs, media, and human rights activists emerging from Russia (Nobelium, Strontium, Seaborgium), China  (Nickel, Gadolinium), North Korea (Osmium), and Iran (Phosphorus). According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, APTs from Iran (Charming Kitten), China (Phantom Panda, Aquatic Panda), and North Korea (Velvet  Chollima, Ricochet Chollima) represented potential threats to think tanks. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, APTs from Iran (Static Kitten, Haywire Kitten, Charming Kitten), China (Cascade Panda, Overcast  Panda, Aquatic Panda, Emissary Panda), the Russian Federation (Fancy Bear, Gossamer Bear), and North Korea (Velvet  Chollima, Ricochet Chollima) represented potential threats to NGOs. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, a North Korean APT (Ricochet Chollima) and Iranian APT (Charming Kitten) represented potential  threats to dissidents. According to CrowdStrike’s Global Threat Landscape, from August 18 to  November 16, 2023, a Russian APT (Fancy Bear) represented a potential threat to nonprofits. After research, state-sponsored actors will often  gain access to organization networks or personal devices via (a) social engineering that lures victims  to divulge account credentials or download malware or (b) having users download seemingly  legitimate apps that house malicious software. Malicious cyber actors often exploit well- known weaknesses in software to deliver their payloads via malware. •  Implement attention grabbing alerts so customers are aware of unsafe configurations,  suspicious behavior, and when they are downloading malware. The  malware deployed enables data theft, surveillance, or advanced cyber intrusions. Notably, these  links frequently conceal malware that provides Velvet Chollima with  unauthorized access to the victim’s personal computer and facilitating the  surveillance of the victim’s communications. The messages result in  code execution or malware download on victim  systems. The links lead to the download of  malware to the victim system generally via social  engineering encouraging recipients to actively click  or copy the URL (this requires the related technique  User Execution [T1204]). They also use Trojanized apps. Examples: The examples below identify how state-sponsored actors use Trojanized applications and  Spyware in their campaigns. Analysis by TrendMicro revealed that upon downloading these apps, the  user's device became infected with malware. Additionally,  the malware granted unauthorized access to the device's camera,  microphone, and screenshot capabilities, exemplifying the group's advanced  and intrusive surveillance techniques.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint CSA to provide  information on Black Basta, a ransomware variant whose actors have encrypted and stolen data from at  least 12 out of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector. Black  Basta is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April 2022. Black  Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America,  Actions for critical infrastructure  organizations to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:    Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware  as soon as they are released. Instead, the  notes provide victims with a unique code and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a  .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Typically, the ransom notes give victims between 10 and  12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site,  Basta News. The authoring organizations urge HPH Sector and all critical infrastructure organizations to apply the  recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from Black  Basta and other ransomware attacks. Victims of ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI  field office or CISA (see the Reporting section for contact information).

North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts,2024-05-02,2,"{'phishing': 10, 'threats_of_violence': 4}","Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR Product ID: JCSA-20240502-001  May 2, 2024                              North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC  Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. The North Korean cyber actors have conducted  spearphishing campaigns posing as legitimate journalists, academics, or other experts in East Asian  affairs with credible links to North Korean policy circles. North Korea leverages these spearphishing  campaigns to collect intelligence on geopolitical events, adversary foreign policy strategies, and any  information affecting North Korean interests by gaining illicit access to targets’ private documents,  research, and communications. This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes indicators of North  Korean social engineering (page 4) for potential victims receiving spearphishing emails as well as  mitigation measures (page 9) for organizations who could be victims of North Korean impersonation. Successful compromises further enable  Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spearphishing emails, which can then be  leveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets. The authoring agencies seek to bring awareness of these campaigns to degrade or minimize the  effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. When an organization securely configures a DMARC policy, it helps ensure  malicious actors, like Kimsuky, are unable to spoof the organization’s legitimate email domain when  sending spearphishing messages to a target. Kimsuky spearphishing campaigns begin with  broad research and preparation, including leveraging open source information to identify potential  targets of value and then creating tailored online personas to appear more realistic and appealing to  their targets. The sample emails beginning on page 5 are real unedited examples of Kimsuky spearphishing  attempts reported to the USG and contain spelling and other errors. This ultimately allows the spearphishing email to be delivered to the victim’s inbox.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to  target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of  ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. In April 2023, following an initial focus  on Windows systems, Akira threat actors deployed a Linux variant targeting VMware ESXi virtual  machines. Akira threat actors have  continued to use both Megazord and Akira, including Akira_v2 (identified by trusted third party  investigations) interchangeably. In some instances,  the FBI identified Akira threat actors creating an administrative account named itadm. According to FBI and open source reporting, Akira threat actors leverage post-exploitation attack  techniques, such as Kerberoasting[5], to extract credentials stored in the process memory of the  Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) [T1003.001].[6] Akira threat actors also use  credential scraping tools [T1003] like Mimikatz and LaZagne to aid in privilege escalation. Cybersecurity researchers have observed Akira threat actors using PowerTool to exploit  the Zemana AntiMalware driver[4] and terminate antivirus-related processes [T1562.001]. Exfiltration and Impact  Akira threat actors leverage tools such as FileZilla, WinRAR [T1560.001], WinSCP, and RClone to  exfiltrate data [T1048]. To establish command and control channels, threat actors leverage readily  available tools like AnyDesk, MobaXterm, RustDesk, Ngrok, and Cloudflare Tunnel, enabling  exfiltration through various protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer  Protocol (SFTP), and cloud storage services like Mega [T1537] to connect to exfiltration servers. The Akira ransom note provides each company with a unique code and instructions  to contact the threat actors via a .onion URL. Akira threat actors do not leave an initial ransom  demand or payment instructions on compromised networks, and do not relay this information until  contacted by the victim. Ransom payments are paid in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses  provided by the threat actors. To further apply pressure, Akira threat actors threaten to publish  exfiltrated data on the Tor network, and in some instances have called victimized companies,  according to FBI reporting. Encryption  Akira threat actors utilize a sophisticated hybrid encryption scheme to lock data.

Threat Actors Exploit Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways,2024-03-01,1,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 20, 'malware': 1}","o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). Co-Authored by:  Product ID: AA24-060B February 29, 2024  TLP:CLEAR   TLP:CLEAR  Threat Actors Exploit Multiple Vulnerabilities in  Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) and the following partners (hereafter referred to as  the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory to warn that cyber threat actors  are exploiting previously identified vulnerabilities in Ivanti  Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways. Authoring organizations:  •  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  •  Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)  •  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC)  •  United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  •  Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), a part of the Communications Security  Establishment  •  New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ)  •  CERT-New Zealand (CERT NZ)  Of particular concern, the authoring organizations and industry partners have determined that cyber  threat actors are able to deceive Ivanti’s internal and external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT), resulting in  a failure to detect compromise. Actions to take today to mitigate cyber  threats against Ivanti appliances:  •  Limit outbound internet connections  from SSL VPN appliances to restrict  access to required services. The vulnerabilities impact all supported versions (9.x and 22.x) and can be used in  a chain of exploits to enable malicious cyber threat actors to bypass authentication, craft malicious  requests, and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. In addition, CISA has  conducted independent research in a lab environment validating that the Ivanti ICT is not sufficient to  detect compromise and that a cyber threat actor may be able to gain root-level persistence despite  issuing factory resets. Based upon the authoring organizations’ observations during incident response activities and  available industry reporting, as supplemented by CISA’s research findings, the authoring  organizations recommend that the safest course of action for network defenders is to assume a  sophisticated threat actor may deploy rootkit level persistence on a device that has been reset and lay  dormant for an arbitrary amount of time. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques in Appendix C for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Volexity identified that threat actors exploited the vulnerabilities to implant web shells,  including GLASSTOKEN and GIFTEDVISITOR, on internal and external-facing web servers  [T1505.003]. Once successfully deployed, these web shells are used to execute commands on  compromised devices.[1]  After Ivanti provided initial mitigation guidance in early January, threat actors developed a way to  bypass those mitigations to deploy BUSHWALK, LIGHTWIRE, and CHAINLINE web shell variants.[2]  Following the actors’ developments, Ivanti disclosed three additional vulnerabilities:  •  CVE-2024-21893 is a server-side request forgery vulnerability in the SAML component of  Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x), and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA  that allows an attacker to access restricted resources without authentication. This vulnerability allows threat actors to gain  elevated privileges to that of an administrator. Observed Threat Actor Activity  CISA has responded to multiple incidents related to the above vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure  and Policy Secure Gateways. As detailed in Appendix A, CISA conducted independent research in a lab environment validating that  the ICT is likely insufficient for detecting compromise and that a cyber threat actor may be able to  maintain root level persistence despite issuing factory resets and appliance upgrades. Activity should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to  support it is used at the direction of, or controlled by, threat actors. If compromise is suspected or detected, organizations should assume that threat  actors hold full administrative access and can perform all tasks associated with the Ivanti Connect  Secure VPN appliance as well as executing arbitrary code and installing malicious payloads. Identify Ivanti hosts with Active Directory (AD) access, threat actors can trivially export active  domain administrator credentials during initial compromise. ▪  Note: Removing malicious administrator accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering  threat actors may have established additional persistence mechanisms. CISA and  NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most  common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and  procedures. These  principles and tactics can limit the impact of  exploitation—such as threat actors  leveraging newly discovered, unpatched  vulnerabilities within Ivanti appliances— thus, strengthening the secure posture for  their customers. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. CISA researchers assess that threat actors are able to use the credentials to move  deeper into the environment. This will limit the ability of an actor to download tools or malware onto the  device or establish outbound connections to command and control (C2) servers."

In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and  to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, or the cloud). Product ID: AA24-060A February 29, 2024 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: Phobos Ransomware  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of  an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail various  ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently  and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise  (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint CSA, to disseminate known TTPs and IOCs associated with the Phobos ransomware variants  observed as recently as February 2024, according to open source reporting. Phobos is structured as  a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. Since May 2019, Phobos ransomware incidents impacting  state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments have been regularly reported to the MS-ISAC. dollars.[1],[2]  The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Phobos ransomware and other  ransomware incidents. For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:  •  AA24-060A (STIX XML, 148KB)  •  AA24-060A (STIX JSON, 120KB)  Actions to take today to mitigate  Phobos ransomware activity:  •  Secure RDP ports to prevent threat  actors from abusing and leveraging  RDP tools. Overview  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware is likely connected to numerous variants  (including Elking, Eight, Devos, Backmydata, and Faust ransomware) due to similar TTPs observed in  Phobos intrusions. Phobos ransomware operates in conjunction with various open source tools such  as Smokeloader, Cobalt Strike, and Bloodhound. Additional Phobos Defense Evasion Capabilities  Phobos ransomware actors have been observed bypassing organizational network defense protocols  by modifying system firewall configurations using commands like netsh firewall set opmode  mode=disable [T1562.004]. Persistence and Privilege Escalation  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware uses commands such as Exec.exe or the  bcdedit[.]exe control mechanism. Furthermore, Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate connected storage devices [T1082], running  processes [T1057], and encrypt user files [T1083]. Each Phobos ransomware executable has unique build identifiers (IDs), affiliate IDs, as well as a  unique ransom note which is embedded in the executable. After the ransom note has populated on  infected workstations, Phobos ransomware continues to search for and encrypt additional files. Malicious File  T1204.002  Phobos actors attached a malicious email  attachment to deliver ransomware. Table 14: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Persistence  Technique Title  ID  Use  Registry Run Keys / Startup  Folder  T1547.001  Phobos ransomware operates using the  Exec.exe control mechanism and has been  observed using Windows Startup folders and Run  Registry Keys. Asynchronous Procedure Call  T1055.004  During phase two of execution, Phobos  ransomware sends a call back from an identified  entry point. Embedded Payloads  T1027.009  Phobos actors embedded the ransomware as a  hidden payload by using Smokeloader. Disable or Modify System  Firewall  T1562.004  Phobos ransomware has been observed  bypassing organizational network defense  protocols through modifying system firewall  configurations. Table 18: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Discovery  Technique Title  ID  Use  Process Discovery  T1057  Phobos ransomware is able to run processes. System Information Discovery  T1082  Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate  connected storage devices. File and Directory Discovery  T1083  Phobos ransomware can encrypt user files. Ingress Tool Transfer  T1105  Phobos ransomware extracts its final payload  from the hashed file. The FBI,  CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend that software  manufacturers incorporate secure by design and  default principles and tactics into their software  development practices limiting the impact of  ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the  secure posture for their customers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including  lateral movement, on a network. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA, NSA, FBI, and Multi-State Information  Sharing and Analysis Center’s (MS-ISAC) Joint #StopRansomware Guide. •  SLTT organizations are encouraged to implement MS-ISAC’s Ransomware Defense-in-Depth  guidance. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. •  Implement EDR solutions to disrupt  threat actor memory allocation  techniques. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. Threat actors leveraging Phobos have notably  deployed remote access tools to establish a remote connection within the compromised network  [T1219].[7]  Alternatively, threat actors send spoofed email attachments [T1566.001] that are embedded with  hidden payloads [T1204.002] such as SmokeLoader, a backdoor trojan that is often used in  conjunction with Phobos. After SmokeLoader’s hidden payload is downloaded onto the victim’s  system, threat actors use the malware’s functionality to download the Phobos payload and exfiltrate  data from the compromised system. Finally, once Smokeloader reaches its third stage, it unpacks a program-erase cycle from stored  memory, which is then sent to be extracted from a SHA 256 hash as a payload.[7] Following  successful payload decryption, the threat actors can begin downloading additional malware.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Mandiant and Microsoft Threat Intelligence contributed to this advisory. Department of Justice, including the FBI, and international partners recently disrupted a  GRU botnet consisting of such routers. An FBI investigation revealed APT28 actors accessed EdgeRouters compromised by Moobot, a  botnet that installs OpenSSH trojans on compromised hardware [T1588]. Trojanized OpenSSH server processes are associated with Moobot, a Mirai- based botnet that infects internet of things (IoT) devices using remotely exploitable vulnerabilities,  such as weak or default passwords. Obtain Capabilities  T1588  APT28 actors accessed EdgeRouters compromised by  Moobot, a botnet that installs OpenSSH trojans on  compromised hardware. Indicators of Compromise  The FBI identified IOCs for the Moobot OpenSSH trojan and for APT28 activity on EdgeRouters.

TLP: CLEAR  TLP: CLEAR  15 February 2024  MU-000174-MW    Identification and Disruption of the Warzone Remote  Access Trojan (RAT)      Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this FLASH to disseminate indicators of  compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Warzone  Remote Access Trojan (RAT), also identified as “Ave Maria” through open-source reporting and  FBI investigation. Beginning in October 2018, the Warzone service offered a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) remote  access trojan, along with other malware products and attracted a customer database of over  7,000 users. The Microsoft  exploits, which allowed malware to be embedded into a .doc or Excel file, exploited the  reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), in particular CVE-2017-8570, CVE- 2017-11882, and CVE-2018-0802. The  malware was often also distributed with or through malicious Microsoft Office files (T1221),  which exploit Microsoft CVE-2017-11882, a CVE that has been in multiple Top Routinely  Exploited Vulnerabilities reports coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency’s (CISA), the FBI, the NSA and FVEY partners. Persistence       During installation, the malware gains persistence by copying itself to  C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ and creating a registry key with a value set to the location of  Warzone’s executable binary to enable automatic execution of the code after each machine  reboot. Communication      The malware communicates with C2 servers via TCP over a configurable port which defaults to  port 5200. Variations in the C2  communications could be attributable to the progressive versions of the malware sold by the  developers. After decrypting the communication and connecting with the C2 server, the  malware collects basic system information about the compromised host, such as PC name and  operating system, and sends it back to the C2 server. Indicators of Compromise  The following are strings that can be used to identify and detect unpacked Warzone payload  inside memory:     •  “warzone160\x00”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server   •  “Ave_Maria Stealer”   o String in the binary code of the RAT   •  “nevergonnagiveyouup”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server      The following are other embedded communication passwords identified through the FBI’s  analysis of data associated with the malware:   •  “warzoneTURBO”  •  “MushroomFunguy”  •  “doghoroscopes”           Recommended Mitigations:  The FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise:  Preparing for Cyber Incidents:  • Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. Protective Controls and Architecture:  • Segment networks to prevent the spread of malware or actor traversal. Network  segmentation can help prevent the spread of malware by controlling traffic flows  between, and access to, various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral  movement. To aid in detecting malware and actor activity,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network."

The authoring agencies have observed cyber threat actors, including the People’s Republic  of China (PRC) [1],[2] and Russian Federation [3] state-sponsored actors, leveraging LOTL  techniques to compromise and maintain persistent access to critical infrastructure  organizations. The authoring agencies are releasing this joint guide for network defenders  (including threat hunters) as the malicious use of LOTL techniques is increasingly emerging  in the broader cyber threat environment. Cyber threat actors leveraging LOTL abuse native tools and processes on systems, often  using “living off the land binaries.” They use LOTL in multiple IT environments, including on- premises, cloud, hybrid, Windows, Linux, and macOS environments. LOTL enables threat  actors to conduct their operations discreetly as they can camouflage activity with typical  system and network behavior, potentially circumventing basic endpoint security capabilities.

In many cases, software  defects or unsecure default configurations allow cyber threat actors to carry out malicious  cyber activity using LOTL techniques. 37       TLP:CLEAR        6  TLP:CLEAR  Introduction  The authoring agencies are releasing this joint guide to warn network defenders that cyber  threat actors, including PRC [1],[2] and Russian Federation [3] state-sponsored actors, are  leveraging living off the land (LOTL) techniques to compromise and maintain persistence in  critical infrastructure organizations. This guide provides information for network defenders—including threat hunters—on LOTL,  network defense weaknesses that enable actors to use LOTL undetected, and detection  guidance. • Authoring agency incident response engagements, including a recent CISA incident  response engagement where cyber threat actors had persistent, long-term access to  the victim’s environment and compromised the domain controller (DC). Cyber threat actors effectively use  LOTL across multiple environments, including in on-premises, cloud, hybrid, Windows, Linux,  and macOS environments, in part because it enables the ability to avoid investing in the  development and deployment of custom tools. Authoring agency incident response teams predominantly observe cyber threat actors  leverage LOTL in Windows environments due to the operating system’s widespread use in  corporate and enterprise settings. In Windows environments, cyber threat actors use native  tools, services, and features, relying on the fact that these components are ubiquitous and  generally trusted. In macOS environments, LOTL is also referred to as “living off the orchard.” Malicious actors  exploit native scripting environments, built-in tools, system configurations, and binaries  referred to as “LOOBins.” In hybrid environments, cyber threat actors are increasingly   TLP:CLEAR        7  TLP:CLEAR  exploiting both physical and cloud-based systems by leveraging sophisticated LOTL  techniques. In addition to LOLBins, cyber threat actors similarly use third-party remote access software,  e.g., remote monitoring and management, endpoint configuration management, EDR, patch  management, mobile device management systems, and database management tools. In large organizations, investigations may take  several months, during which cyber threat actors expand their access. o Threat actors can easily modify known IOCs, such as filenames and command  line arguments, or modify content to change the hash. Cyber threat actors bypass  conventional, “known-bad"" detections by modifying common IOCs such as  filenames, file paths, and command and control destinations. Identify and  prioritize essential IP ranges for organizational operations, apply selective  restrictions on others, and routinely review and update allowlists for adaptability  and security against emerging threats. This dynamic can cause system administrators to prioritize Windows   TLP:CLEAR        10 TLP:CLEAR  over macOS when hunting threats. Configure  These recommendations are not foolproof  but are part of a multi-faceted and  comprehensive approach to mitigating  LOTL cyber threats. Cyber  threat actors may take advantage of unused services or regions that are  not actively monitored to avoid detection. Log aggregation is critical because some cyber  threat actors are known to clear or modify local system event logs. Enhance network monitoring, log retention, and threat hunting to identify  prolonged adversary presence. Extending log storage, fine-tuning anomaly  detection, and deepening threat hunting tactics can help uncover threat actors  leveraging LOTL techniques over immediate and extended dwell periods. These accounts are  targets for threat actors because they frequently have additional, unnecessary  privileges and do not utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA). If the host does not require a specific piece of software, uninstall it to  limit the tools available to cyber threat actors. Cyber threat actors who obtain an initial foothold through exploitation of internet- facing services frequently rely on LOLBins for initial execution, reconnaissance,  and deployment of secondary payloads. Refine monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms to differentiate  between typical administrative actions and potential threat behavior. Consider implementing a threat detection maturity model to develop, implement,  test, and tune alerting mechanisms enabled within network and host intrusion  detection systems or SIEM. Leverage user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to analyze and correlate activities  across multiple data sources, to identify potential security incidents that may be  missed by traditional tools, and to profile and monitor user behavior, detecting  insider threats or compromised accounts. If a  threat actor compromises a host with cached credentials, the actor can often find  and reuse those credentials to gain access to other hosts and services. Enhance network segmentation and monitoring to limit lateral movement  possibilities for threat actors. Abnormal network behavior may indicate the presence  of a threat actor that evaded host-based detections, possibly via LOTL techniques. When a cyber threat actor compromises legitimate credentials, having  appropriate network segmentation limits the “blast radius” of accessible systems. Snort, Suricata) to  improve LOTL threat detection. Select vendors with secure by design principles in place  to reduce the availability of LOLBins that threat actors can leverage. Network defenders can find host artifacts, unless the threat actor deletes them, without  making configuration changes to the system. Such obfuscation methods are often used by  cyber threat actors to bypass security monitoring tools and execute malicious  payloads without detection. o Cyber threat actors can bypass standard event logs for registering services and  scheduled tasks purely by writing to the registry since this does not create  standard system events. Tailored Detection Examples  Understanding the context of LOTL activities is crucial for accurate detection and response,  so this section includes tailored detection guidance from real-word examples—specifically  ntdsutil.exe and psexec.exe, which are frequently used by state-sponsored advanced  persistent threat (APT) actors in compromised environments. Through strict network segmentation and the enforcement of principles of least privilege, an  organization could restrict the threat actor’s ability to move laterally across the network. Additionally, robust privileged access management would  ensure that elevated access is granted sparingly and monitored closely, making it  challenging for a cyber threat actor to misuse stolen credentials. Investigate to determine the highest privilege level account that the threat actor had  or has access to. If the threat actor has control of an administrative account, such as Windows  Active Directory Domain Admin, reset credentials of privileged and non-privileged  accounts within the trust boundary of each compromised account. If alerting the cyber threat actor needs to be avoided   TLP:CLEAR        27 TLP:CLEAR  (e.g., for intelligence purposes), then privileges can be reduced for affected  accounts/devices to “contain” them. Reset the relevant account credentials or access keys if the investigation finds  the threat actor’s access is limited to non-elevated permissions. Insecure  software allows threat actors to leverage flaws to enable LOTL techniques and the  responsibility should not solely be on the end user. • Minimize attack surfaces that can be leveraged by cyber threat actors using LOTL techniques. Disable unnecessary protocols by default, limit the number of processes and programs running with escalated privileges, and take other steps to limit the ability for cyber threat actors to leverage native functionality to conduct intrusions. When  configuration is necessary, the default option should be broadly secure against  common threats. TLP:CLEAR  32 TLP:CLEAR  Acknowledgements  The following organizations contributed to this guide:  • Amazon Web Services (AWS) • Energy industry representatives, through the DOE CESER Energy Threat Analysis  Center (ETAC) pilot. TLP:CLEAR  33 TLP:CLEAR  Appendix A: LOTL in WIndows, Linux, MacOS, and Hybrid  Environments  Windows  Some common LOLBins cyber threat actors use in Windows (on-premises and hybrid)  environments are wmic.exe, ntdsutil.exe, Netsh, cmd.exe, PowerShell for execution. Modifications were made to the MountPoints2\CPC registry keys for three user accounts, suggesting cyber threat actors attempted to hide indications of data exfiltration. • CISA observed the threat actors use the Netsh command to create a portProxy registry modification on compromised devices. This registry setting caused inbound traffic on port 49275 to be forwarded to a suspected threat actor command and control server on port 8443. Linux  Some common LOLBins cyber threat actors use in Linux environments are curl,  systemctl, systemd, and python. For example, cyber threat actors:  • Use scripting environments like Python to gain interactive shell access, generate a reverse shell, transfer files, or to run custom scripts on compromised devices. TLP:CLEAR  34 TLP:CLEAR  • Scripting Environment and Tool Exploitation in macOS: Cyber threat actors exploit macOS's native scripting languages and built-in tools for malicious purposes. • Manipulating Property List (PLIST) files for persistence: Cyber threat actors may modify PLIST files to automatically execute malicious payloads during system startup or user login. • Escalating privileges via misconfigured sudoers: Cyber threat actors may exploit sudoers misconfigurations that allow executing commands as a superuser without a password, enabling them to gain elevated access. • Bypassing Gatekeeper for malware execution: Cyber threat actors may bypass Gatekeeper by leveraging trusted developer certificates or modifying system settings to allow execution from unidentified developers. Cyber threat actors who gain access to virtual instances may attempt to query the IMDS API to obtain credentials and gain further access to cloud resources [4]. • Achieve persistence through scheduled tasks: Cloud automation services can be used by cyber threat actors to achieve persistence in the environment by creating or modifying an event trigger to run malicious scripts whenever the event occurs. Cyber threat actors may also use this technique to escalate privileges by taking advantage of the fact that these automated actions can be configured to run under a different account than the user (such as a service account, which may have more privileges than the cyber threat actor) [5]. Threat actors can target these accounts to achieve persistent access to the cloud tenant rather than having to continually bypass MFA protections on user accounts even with compromised credentials. Cyber threat actors can leverage these services to exfiltrate traffic [6]. CLI tools can be  misused for unauthorized activities on cloud resources, including data exfiltration  and establishing persistent threats. Threat actors target ADFS to compromise and  manipulate federation tokens and impersonate legitimate users or entities. This  allows threat actors to gain unauthorized access to a multitude of resources. • Token manipulation and replay attacks: In hybrid environments, threat actors exploit  the inherent trust between on-premises identity providers and cloud services. CLI tools can  be misused for unauthorized activities on cloud resources, including data exfiltration  and establishing persistent threats. Threat actors can  exploit these platforms to gain comprehensive insights into the hybrid infrastructure,  modify configurations, or deploy malicious elements. TLP:CLEAR        36 TLP:CLEAR  Appendix B: Third-Party Tools for LOTL  Cyber threat actors use deployed software/remote access software, including the following,  for LOTL:  • Mobile device management systems. Mobile device management (MDM) systems  are attractive targets for threat actors because they provide elevated access to  thousands of mobile devices. RMM software has significant capabilities to monitor or operate devices and  systems as well as attain heightened permissions, making it an attractive tool for  cyber threat actors to maintain persistence and move laterally on compromised  networks. • EDR: Cyber threat actors leverage common EDR tools installed on the victim  networks to take advantage of the tools’ remote-shell capabilities.[7]  • VM management tools: Cyber threat actors target vital virtualization management  tools to exploit VM infrastructures. • Database management tools: Cyber threat actors can target database management  tools to execute SQL commands, extract sensitive data, or manipulate database  entries. The compromise of these  systems can lead to a cyber threat actor’s ability to monitor network traffic, alter  configurations, and potentially disrupt network operations, exploiting the very tools  used to ensure network stability and security. IAM systems, which are central to  managing network user identities and access, are frequently targeted by cyber threat  actors for their critical role in network access control. Cyber threat actors can manipulate IT service  management (ITSM) platforms, exploiting these systems to alter tickets, workflows,  and trigger automated actions for malicious purposes. Cyber threat actors can abuse these shells as  LOLBins to carry out malicious operations. Cyber threat actors can use these scripting  interpreters to perform arbitrary code execution.

For  example, data breach notification requirements vary by state. In recent years, various malicious cyber incidents have impacted WWS  including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, and ransomware.3   Cyber threat actors frequently use ransomware against WWS utilities. On internet-facing  operational technology (OT) networks, ransomware can quickly propagate to affect  operations. For example, in July 2021, criminal cyber actors used the ransomware ZuCaNo,  via remote access, to compromise a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)  computer on the OT network of a Maine-based WWS utility. Additionally, in August 2021, malicious cyber  actors used Ghost variant ransomware against a California-based WWS utility. The  ransomware variant resided in the system for about a month before discovery when three  SCADA servers displayed a ransomware message.4  Nation-state cyber actors also have demonstrated an intent to target U.S. • Share cyber threat information. critical infrastructure sectors—including  Energy and Healthcare and Public Health—have on the WWS makes the Sector a target for  cyber threat actors. “Ongoing Cyber Threats to U.S. • FBI, which is the federal lead for threat response, counterterrorism and  counterintelligence, and federal law enforcement. • ODNI, which is the intelligence lead for threat awareness and analysis. Third, after confirming and reporting the incident at the organizational level, the utility  should determine whether they are able to participate in state/federal-level collective  analysis actions for the threat activity. Federal and state government work in tandem with organizations like the  WaterISAC, American Water Works Association, and Water Environment Federation (WEF) to  develop a clearer picture of the Sector’s threat landscape.

Known Indicators of Compromise Associated with Androxgh0st Malware,2024-01-16,1,"{'threats_of_violence': 33, 'botnet': 4, 'malware': 10}","Product ID: AA24-016A January 16, 2024 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Known Indicators of Compromise Associated  with Androxgh0st Malware  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to  disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and  tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated  with threat actors deploying Androxgh0st malware. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations. In particular, threat actors deploying Androxgh0st  have been observed exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to remotely run hypertext preprocessor (PHP) code  on fallible websites via PHPUnit [T1190]. This  PHP page runs PHP code submitted through a POST request, which allows the threat actors to  remotely execute code. Threat actors are further able to set up a fake (illegitimate) page accessible via the URI to  provide backdoor access to the website. This allows threat actors to download additional malicious  files for their operations and access databases. After identifying websites using the Laravel web application, threat actors attempt to  determine if the domain’s root-level .env file is exposed and contains credentials for accessing  additional services. Threat actors often  target .env files to steal these credentials within the environment variables. If the .env file is exposed, threat actors will issue a GET request to the /.env URI to attempt to  access the data on the page. This data is  frequently used as an identifier for the threat actor. A successful response  from either of these methods allows the threat actors to look for usernames, passwords, and/or other  credentials pertaining to services such as email (via SMTP) and AWS accounts. If the threat actors successfully identify the Laravel application key, they will attempt  exploitation by using the key to encrypt PHP code [T1027.010]. In doing so, the threat actors can upload files to the website via  remote access. Threat actors can  identify uniform resource locators (URLs) for files outside root directory through a path traversal  attack [T1083]. If threat actors obtain credentials for any services using the above methods, they may use these  credentials to access sensitive data or use these services to conduct additional malicious operations. For example, when threat actors successfully identify and compromise AWS credentials from a  vulnerable website, they have been observed attempting to create new users and user policies  [T1136]. Table 1: Reconnaissance  Technique Title  ID  Use  Active Scanning:  Vulnerability  Scanning  T1595.002  The threat actor scans websites for specific vulnerabilities  to exploit.

Multiple, ongoing investigations and trusted third party  reporting yielded the IOCs and TTPs, and provided  information on Androxgh0st malware’s ability to  establish a botnet that can further identify and  compromise vulnerable networks. Overview  Androxgh0st malware has been observed establishing a botnet [T1583.005] for victim identification  and exploitation in target networks. Laravel Framework Targeting  Androxgh0st malware establishes a botnet to scan for websites using the Laravel web application  framework. According to open source reporting[1], Androxgh0st is a Python- scripted malware [T1059.006] primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information,  such as credentials [T1552.001] for various high profile applications (i.e., Amazon Web Services  [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework). Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning [T1046] and exploiting exposed credentials [T1078] and  application programming interfaces (APIs) [T1114], and web shell deployment [T1505.003]. Targeting the PHPUnit  Androxgh0st malware TTPs commonly involves the use of scripts, conducting scanning [T1595] and  searching for websites with specific vulnerabilities. The FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by actors using Androxgh0st malware."
Creating and maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture,2025-09-29,3,"{'ransomware': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 22, 'malware': 1}","It is critical that backups are implemented to be  ransomware resistant to protect their availability. As the number and capability of threat actor targeting OT increases, so too does the  need for robust cyber security controls. Skilled threat actors will seek to gain insight into a target system to support their capability  development and attack planning. To achieve these aims, threat actors require information on how your system  is architected, secured and operates. There are three primary ways that threat actors can use OT information to finesse their cyber  attacks:  Inform  Data can help a threat actor understand the broader context of their target system. Threat actors may seek information on dependent systems that rely on, or  contribute to, the correct operation of the target system. 13  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  A good approach is to consider the information an attacker would require within your threat  modelling. After identifying the relevant information for each threat scenario, you can then  analyse how an attacker might exploit that information and assess how critical its compromise is  to their overall success. A data aggregation risk arises when threat actors have access to a collection of information that,  when combined, can lead to development of capabilities that would not be possible using the  individual pieces alone (this is described as latent intelligence). You should understand how  information could be combined by a threat actor to chain together attack paths. Summary:  You will be able to identify the OT information that supports different threat  scenarios, understand the ways threat actors seek to exploit this information and recognise  how aggregating OT information increases this risk. 17  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  Exposure  Exposure refers to the discoverability and accessibility of networked devices within an  organisation, which could make them vulnerable to potential threats. When looking at updating in this scenario, you might choose to prioritise updates or  maintenance of the firewall due to its exposure to threats, despite the fact it is less critical to  the OT system. Your organisation should use a comprehensive risk management framework to inform these  decisions, such as the NCSC's risk management framework (which aligns with international  standards such as ISO 27001 and includes vital techniques such as threat modelling and attack  trees ). For instance, the use of wireless communication technologies can elevate risks, as  threat actors may not need to be physically present to exploit the system. 21  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  •  a reference to the how the record is maintained in line with existing change management  policies  •  a process for periodic reviews to confirm the necessity of each connection against  associated risks to the OT network and evolving threats  Additional risk assessments should be performed for external connections to assess if connectivity  is required, as well as the security controls implemented. This is especially critical for systems connected to external networks,  where exposure to threats is higher. 24  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  Continuous network monitoring and alerting  Maintaining persistent visibility enables you to detect anomalies, identify potential threats, and  respond to incidents before they escalate. This includes using multi- factor authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and regular access reviews to reduce the  risk of unauthorised access or insider threats. If security compromises have been necessary in the external connectivity, you should have  mitigating controls in place to limit the potential impact of a threat actor if a compromise occurs. These are likely to fall into 3 trust levels:  Equal trust   Information sharing routes with other critical national infrastructure (CNI) organisations that  operate within the same threat model, and where you have assurance over the technical controls  they have implemented. Note: The use of removable media should be restricted to approved items, as removable media  introduces an additional attack vector through which a threat actor can enter the environment. For example, a threat actor could use malicious USB device to emulates a trusted Human  Interface Device (HID), such as a keyboard, to perform keystroke injection attacks. Once  connected, the device can rapidly deliver pre-programmed keystrokes to execute commands,  install malware, or alter system configurations."

Some UNC6040 victims have subsequently received extortion emails allegedly from the  ShinyHunters group, demanding payment in cryptocurrency to avoid publication of exfiltrated  data. These extortion demands have varied in time following UNC6040 threat actors’ access  and data exfiltration, ranging from a period of days to months. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. To do so, UNC6040 threat actors commonly call victims’ call centers posing  as IT support employees addressing enterprise-wide connectivity issues. After obtaining access, UNC6040  threat actors have then used API queries to exfiltrate large volumes of data in bulk. UNC6040 threat actors have also directly requested user credentials and multifactor  authentication codes to authenticate and add the Salesforce Data Loader application,  facilitating data exfiltration. UNC6040 threat actors have deceived victims into authorizing  malicious connected apps to their organization's Salesforce portal. This  grants UNC6040 threat actors significant capabilities to access, query, and exfiltrate sensitive  information directly from the compromised Salesforce customer environments. UNC6040 threat actors have created malicious applications within Salesforce trial accounts,  allowing the threat actors the ability to register the connected apps without using a legitimate  corporate account, making detection difficult. In August of 2025, UNC6395 threat actors exploited compromised OAuth tokens for  the Salesloft Drift application, an AI chatbot that can be integrated with Salesforce. Using the       TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  compromised OAuth tokens and third-party app integration, UNC6395 threat actors were able  to compromise victims’ Salesforce instances and exfiltrate data. On August 20, 2025, Salesloft, in collaboration with Salesforce, revoked all active access and  refresh tokens with the Drift application, terminating any threat actor access to victims’  Salesforce platforms from the previously connected Salesloft app."

Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. ▪  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, leverage a tool  that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities. Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Royal  Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre  (ACSC), Australian Federal Police (AFP), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United Kingdom’s  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)—hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations—are  releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory in response to recent activity by Scattered Spider threat actors  against the commercial facilities sectors, subsectors, and other sectors. While some TTPs remain consistent, Scattered Spider threat actors often change TTPs to remain  undetected. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for tables of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. According to public reporting, Scattered Spider threat actors have:2  ▪  Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598] [T1656]. The FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors, after gaining access to networks, using publicly available,  legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Update End  Scattered Spider threat actors historically evade detection on target networks by using living off the land  (LOTL) techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate a targeted organization’s network, as well as  frequently modifying their TTPs. After exfiltrating and/or  encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors communicate with targeted organizations via TOR, Tox,  email, or encrypted applications. Table 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors  Domains  targetsname-sso[.]com  targetsname-servicedesk[.]com  targetsname-okta[.]com  Update July 29, 2025:   targetsname-cms[.]com  targetsname-helpdesk[.]com  oktalogin-targetcompany[.]com  The targeted organization’s name is often appended with either a -helpdesk or a type of single sign-on  (SSO) solution to add credibility. While Scattered Spider threat actors have not been observed using these  techniques recently, the group continuously evolves its TTPs and these methods could be reused. Scattered Spider threat actors currently use a variety of methods to gain initial access to a targeted  organization’s network. In some instances, the threat actors purchase employee or contractor credentials  on illicit marketplaces such as Russia Market [T1597.002]. In other cases, the threat actors compromise  third party services with access to several potential targeted organization’s networks [T1199]. It is common  for the threat actors to gather the personally identifiable information (PII) of users with elevated access to  their network using online open-source information. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII [T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use  layered social engineering techniques [T1656] which frequently occur over several calls [T1598.004]. Once that information is identified, the threat actors continue to conduct phone calls to  employees and help desks to gather password reset specific information of a targeted employee. Finally, the threat actors conduct spearphising calls to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords  and/or transfer MFA tokens [T1078.002] [T1199] [T1566.004]. At which point, the threat actors perform  account takeovers against the users in SSO environments. Scattered Spider threat actor tactics and techniques  also make it more difficult for network defenders to warn targeted organizations or to use threat hunting  tools to proactively identify intrusions. Update End  Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation  Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006] [T1606] and deploy remote  monitoring and management (RMM) tools [T1219] after compromising a user’s account to establish  persistence [TA0003]. Historically, the threat actors added a federated identity provider to the targeted  organization’s SSO tenant and activated automatic account linking [T1484.002]. While the threat actors  may still be using this tactic, it has not been identified as a current TTP. The threat actors were then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO account attribute. At  this stage, Scattered Spider threat actors already controlled the identity provider and then could choose an  arbitrary value for this account attribute. This activity allowed the threat actors to perform privilege  escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords were changed [T1078]. Threat actors  achieve elevated privileges by leveraging internal communication tools to contact employees and social  engineering. Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration  Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform  discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation  [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging into  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the targeted organization’s Active  Directory (AD) and then perform discovery and exfiltration of the targeted organization’s code repositories  [T1213.003], code-signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083] [TA0010]. Threat actors  activate Amazon Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral  movement [TA0007] [TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Update July 29, 2025:  In many instances, Scattered Spider threat actors search for a targeted organization’s Snowflake access to  exfiltrate large volumes of data in a short time, often running thousands of queries immediately [T1567]. Update End  To determine if their activities have been detected and to maintain persistence within the compromised  system, Scattered Spider threat actors often search a targeted organization’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and  Microsoft Exchange Online for emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actors’ intrusion and  any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and  teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new  avenues of intrusion in response to a targeted organizations’ defenses. Scattered Spider threat actors  consistently use proxy networks [T1090] and rotate machine names to further hamper detection and  response. Update End  MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  See Table 4 to Table 17 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory.

#StopRansomware: Interlock,2025-07-22,3,"{'extortion': 5, 'ransomware': 25, 'threats_of_violence': 14, 'malware': 3}","Interlock actors employ a double extortion model in which actors encrypt systems after exfiltrating data,  which increases pressure on victims to pay the ransom to both get their data decrypted and prevent it from  being leaked. Interlock actors leverage a double extortion model, in which they both encrypt and exfiltrate victim data. Interlock actors use a double- extortion model [T1657], encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. Interlock actors do not leave an initial ransom demand or payment instructions on compromised networks,  and do not relay this information until contacted by the victim. Actors use a double- extortion model, both encrypting victim data and threatening release  of victim data on their Tor network leak site if the ransom is not paid. TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA25-203A          #StopRansomware: Interlock    Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories  for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These  #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. The Interlock ransomware variant was first observed in late September 2024, targeting various business,  critical infrastructure, and other organizations in North America and Europe. FBI observed actors  obtaining initial access via drive-by download from compromised legitimate websites, which is an  uncommon method among ransomware groups. FBI, CISA, HHS, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Interlock ransomware incidents. Overview  Since September 2024, Interlock ransomware actors have impacted a wide range of businesses and  critical infrastructure sectors in North America and Europe. Initial Access  FBI has observed Interlock actors obtaining initial access [TA0001] via drive-by download [T1189] from  compromised legitimate websites, an atypical method for ransomware actors. Interlock ransomware  methods for initial access have previously disguised malicious payloads as fake Google Chrome or  Microsoft Edge browser updates, though a cybersecurity company recently reported a shift to payload  filenames masquerading as updates for common security software (see Table 3 and Table 4 for a list of  filenames).1F2  In some instances, FBI has observed Interlock actors using the ClickFix social engineering technique, in  which unsuspecting users are prompted to execute a malicious payload by clicking a fake Completely  Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) [T1189]. According to open source reporting, the credential stealer collects login  information and associated URLs for victims’ online accounts [T1555.003], while the keylogger dynamic  link library (DLL) logs users’ keystrokes in a file named conhost.txt [T1036.005].6F7 As of February 2025,  private cybersecurity analysts also observed Interlock ransomware infections executing different versions  of information stealers [TA0006], including Lumma Stealer7F8 and Berserk Stealer, to harvest credentials for  lateral movement and privilege escalation [T1078].8F9  Interlock actors leverage compromised credentials and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)9F10 [T1021.001] to  move between systems. FBI has observed Interlock ransomware encryptors for both Windows  and Linux operating systems. The ransom note provides each victim  with a unique code and instructions to contact the ransomware actors via a .onion URL. Tools Used by Interlock Ransomware Actors  Tool Name  Description  AnyDesk  A common legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool maliciously used by  Interlock actors to obtain remote access and maintain persistence. Leveraged Files  See Table 3 and Table 4 for files used by Interlock ransomware actors. Mitigations  The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your  organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Interlock ransomware actors’ activity. At-risk organizations should implement the following mitigations:    Prevent Interlock ransomware actors from obtaining initial access:  o Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering to block users from accessing malicious sites  and applications.   Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. o Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows  between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware [CPG 3.A] with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 2.T]. o To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic,  including lateral movement activity on a network.   #StopRansomware Guide: Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack.   Cyber Hygiene Services, Ransomware Readiness Assessment: CISA’s no-cost cyber hygiene  services.   Combatting Ransomware: MS-ISAC guidance on ransomware mitigation strategies aligned with  recommendations from NIST and CSF. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. 7 Biasiotto, “Unwrapping the Emerging Interlock Ransomware Attack.”  8 International law-enforcement and Microsoft took down the Lumma Stealer malware in May 2025 by  seizing internet domains the actors used to distribute the malware to actors and taking down domains that  hosted the malware’s infrastructure. 17 Sekoia Threat Detection and Research team, “Interlock Ransomware Evolving Under the Radar.” See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for tables mapped to the threat actors’ activity. To counter Interlock actors’ threat to VMs, enterprise defenders should implement  robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling and capabilities. Disclaimer: Use of these tools and applications should not be attributed as malicious without analytical  evidence to support threat actor use and/or control. Disclaimer: Some of the hashes are for legitimate tools and applications and should not be attributed as  malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on  existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats  and TTPs. In addition to the below mitigations, Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) organizations should use HPH  Sector CPGs to implement cybersecurity protections to address the most common threats and TTPs used  against this sector. o Timely patching is efficient and cost effective for minimizing an organization’s exposure to  cybersecurity threats. o This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services that they have  established for persistence. o Disabling software utilities that run from the command line makes it more difficult for threat  actors to escalate privileges and move laterally. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating  your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication  to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet  information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. The CAPTCHA  contains instructions for users to open the Windows Run window, paste the clipboard contents, and then  execute a malicious Base64-encoded PowerShell process [T1204.004].2F3  Note: This ClickFix technique has been used in several other malware campaigns, including Lumma Stealer  and DarkGate.3F4  Execution and Persistence  Based on FBI investigations, the fake Google Chrome browser executable functions as a remote access  trojan (RAT) [T1105] designed to execute a PowerShell script [T1059.001] that drops a file into the  Windows Startup folder. Initial Access  Technique Title   ID  Use  Drive-By Compromise  T1189  Interlock actors obtain initial access by compromising a legitimate  website that network users visit, or by disguising malicious payloads  as fake browser updates or common security software, including the  following:16F17   FortiClient.exe   Ivanti-Secure-Access-Client.exe   GlobalProtect.exe   Webex.exe   AnyConnectVPN.exe   Cisco-Secure-Client.exe   zyzoom_antimalware.exe  Interlock actors also gain access via the ClickFix social engineering  technique, in which users are tricked into executing a malicious  payload by clicking on a fake CAPTCHA that prompts users to  execute a malicious PowerShell script."

This  cyber bulletin aims to raise awareness of the threat posed by PRC cyber threat activity, particularly to Canadian  telecommunications organizations, in light of new Salt Typhoon-related compromises of entities in Canada. The threat to Canadian organizations  The Cyber Centre is aware of malicious cyber activities currently targeting Canadian telecommunications companies. Targeting of Canadian devices may allow the threat actors to collect information from the victim’s  internal network, or use the victim’s device to enable the compromise of further victims. In some cases, we assess that the  threat actors’ activities were very likely limited to network reconnaissance. To monitor and mitigate this threat, we encourage Canadian organizations to consult the  guidance linked below on hardening networks, security considerations for edge devices, and additional cyber threat  information pertaining to the PRC. The threat to telecommunications  Telecommunications networks are almost certainly among the highest priority espionage targets for state-sponsored cyber  threat actors. State-sponsored cyber threat actors have persistently compromised TSPs globally, often as part of broad and long-running  intelligence programs to exfiltrate bulk customer data and collect information on high-value targets of interest, such as  government officials. In 2024, partner investigations discovered that PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors had compromised the networks of  major global TSPs, including US wireless carriers, very likely as part of a targeted espionage operation. The threat actors also collected  the private communications of a limited number of individuals primarily involved in government or political activity. PRC cyber threat actors frequently attempt to compromise trusted service providers, including  telecommunications, managed service providers and cloud service providers, to access client information or networks  indirectly. PRC cyber actors exploit vulnerabilities in edge devices  As we note in the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026, cyber threat actors are exploiting vulnerabilities in security  and networking devices that sit at the perimeter of networks, including routers, firewalls, and virtual private network (VPN)  solutions. By compromising these edge devices, a cyber threat actor can enter a network, monitor, modify, and exfiltrate  network traffic flowing through the device, or possibly move deeper into the victim network.

These  #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Note: Updates to this advisory, originally published December 18, 2023, include:  ▪  June 4, 2025: The advisory was updated to reflect new TTPs employed by Play ransomware group,  as well as provide current IOCs/remove outdated IOCs for effective threat hunting. Update June 4, 2025:  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) are releasing this joint  advisory to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations  as recently as January 2025. End Update  Since June 2022, the Play (also known as Playcrypt) ransomware group has impacted a wide range of  businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. Play ransomware was  among the most active ransomware groups in 2024. Organizations should take the following actions today to mitigate cyber threats from Play ransomware:  ▪  Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Update June 4, 2025:  As of May 2025, FBI was aware of approximately 900 affected entities allegedly exploited by the  ransomware actors. End Update  In Australia, the first Play ransomware incident was observed in April 2023, and most recently in November  2023. The Play ransomware group is presumed to be a closed group, designed to “guarantee the secrecy of  deals,” according to a statement on the group’s data leak website. End Update  FBI, CISA, and ASD’s ACSC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Play ransomware actors have  been observed using external-facing services [T1133] such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual  Private Networks (VPN) for initial access. Update June 4, 2025:  Multiple ransomware groups, including initial access brokers with ties to Play ransomware operators,  exploited three vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-57727—in remote monitoring and management (RMM)  tool SimpleHelp [T1190] to conduct remote code execution [T1059.001] at many U.S.-based entities  following the vulnerabilities’ disclosure on 16 January 2025. End Update  Discovery and Defense Evasion  Play ransomware actors use tools like AdFind to run Active Directory queries [TA0007] and Grixba,1 an  information-stealer, to enumerate network information [T1016] and scan for anti-virus software  [T1518.001]. In some instances, cybersecurity researchers have  observed Play ransomware actors using PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender.2  Lateral Movement and Execution  Play ransomware actors use command and control (C2) applications, including Cobalt Strike and  SystemBC, and tools like PsExec to assist with lateral movement and file execution. Once established on a  network, the ransomware actors search for unsecured credentials [T1552] and use the Mimikatz  credential dumper to gain domain administrator access [T1003]. According to open source reporting,3 to  further enumerate vulnerabilities, Play ransomware actors use Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome  Scripts (WinPEAS) [T1059] to search for additional privilege escalation paths. Exfiltration and Encryption  Update June 4, 2025:  The Play ransomware binary is recompiled for every attack, resulting in unique hashes for each  deployment, complicating anti-malware and anti-virus program detection of the ransomware [T1027].

The authoring agencies and industry partners have observed BADBAZAAR and  MOONSHINE specifically targeting individuals connected to topics considered by  the Chinese state to be a threat to their domestic authority, ambitions and global  reputation. This advisory aims to help those at risk respond effectively to the specific threat  from  BADBAZAAR  and  MOONSHINE  spyware. This makes apps from official  stores safer, but as demonstrated in the case studies and the NCSC’s App Store  Threat Report, these processes are not perfect. Page 5 of 30      Following these four tips can help protect you from the threats outlined in this advisory. Citizens from the co-sealing nations, in  China and abroad, who are perceived to be supporting causes that threaten  regime stability, are almost certainly under threat from mobile malware such as  BADBAZAAR and MOONSHINE. Page 14 of 30  Mitigation measures for mobile app users   The authoring agencies encourage the following security practices to protect  against the threats described in the case studies. Case study two: BADBAZAAR  BADBAZAAR is a mobile malware with iOS and Android variants that has targeted  Uyghurs, Tibetans and Taiwanese individuals. This malware has been spread via  social media platforms and official app stores. To  spread the malware further, the actors also advertised the app in a Telegram                 ‘tibetanphone’. Page 13 of 30  Assessment  BADBAZAAR and MOONSHINE use several social engineering methods to  specifically target Uyghur, Tibetan and Taiwanese communities, namely:   • the trojanisation of apps of interest to these communities, such as a Uyghur  language Quran app, is almost certainly tailored to the target victim base  • the adding of these trojanised apps to official app stores highly likely lends  a sense of legitimacy, and the sharing in group chats is highly likely intended  to exploit trusted relationships within these communities  BADBAZAAR and MOONSHINE collect data which would almost certainly be of value  to the Chinese state. Although BADBAZAAR and MOONSHINE have been observed  targeting Uyghur, Tibetan and Taiwanese individuals, there are other malwares  that target other minority groups in China. See NCSC guidance about staying secure online, to  protect against known viruses and other kinds of malware. Where you can, restrict app permissions to minimise data  exposure, as malware is often designed to access protected files or  peripherals, such as cameras and microphones.

A Comprehensive guide to Detect Ransomware. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Cybersecurity Advisory  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  Executive summary  Many networks have a gap in their defenses for detecting and blocking a malicious  technique known as “fast flux.” This technique poses a significant threat to national  security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection. The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian Signals Directorate’s  Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security  (CCCS), and New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) are releasing  this joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) to warn organizations, Internet service providers  (ISPs), and cybersecurity service providers of the ongoing threat of fast flux enabled  malicious activities as a defensive gap in many networks. This advisory is meant to  encourage service providers, especially Protective DNS (PDNS) providers, to help  mitigate this threat by taking proactive steps to develop accurate, reliable, and timely  fast flux detection analytics and blocking capabilities for their customers. This CSA also  provides guidance on detecting and mitigating elements of malicious fast flux by  adopting a multi-layered approach that combines DNS analysis, network monitoring,  and threat intelligence. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  2  Technical details  When malicious cyber actors compromise devices and networks, the malware they use  needs to “call home” to send status updates and receive further instructions. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  3  Note: This behavior can also be used for legitimate purposes for performance  reasons in dynamic hosting environments, such as in content delivery networks  and load balancers. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  4    Bulletproof hosting (BPH) services offer Internet hosting that disregards or  evades law enforcement requests and abuse notices. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  5  used for maintaining high availability for cybercriminal forums and marketplaces, making  them resilient against law enforcement takedown efforts.

#StopRansomware: Medusa Ransomware,2025-03-12,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'extortion': 4, 'ransomware': 16, 'threats_of_violence': 13, 'malware': 1}","Medusa IABs  (affiliates) are known to make use of common techniques, such as:    Phishing campaigns as a primary method for stealing victim credentials [T1566]. These email addresses are not  associated with phishing activity conducted by Medusa actors. Phishing  T1566  Medusa IABS used phishing campaigns as a primary method for  delivering ransomware to victims. Both Medusa developers and affiliates—referred to as “Medusa actors” in this advisory— employ a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release  exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid. Extortion  Medusa RaaS employs a double extortion model, where victims must pay [T1657] to decrypt files and  prevent further release. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets. FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa  actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid and requested half of the  payment be made again to provide the “true decryptor”— potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme. TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA25-071A      #StopRansomware: Medusa Ransomware  Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders detailing various  ransomware variants and ransomware threat  actors. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators  of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect  against ransomware. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing  and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint advisory to disseminate known Medusa  ransomware TTPs and IOCs, identified through FBI  investigations as recently as February 2025. Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant first identified in June 2021. The Medusa ransomware variant is unrelated to the MedusaLocker variant and the  Medusa mobile malware variant per the FBI’s investigation. FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents. Background  The RaaS Medusa variant has been used to conduct ransomware attacks from 2021 to present. Medusa  originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations  were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Resources    Joint #StopRansomware Guide. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files  will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities.

Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services  that they have established for persistence. If threat actors are  not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally  [CPG 2.E, 2.N].

Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail  various ransomware variants and ransomware  threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators  of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect  against ransomware. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing  and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint advisory to disseminate known Ghost (Cring)— (“Ghost”)—ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified  through FBI investigation as recently as January  2025. Ghost actors rotate their ransomware executable payloads, switch file extensions for encrypted files,  modify ransom note text, and use numerous ransom email addresses, which has led to variable attribution  of this group over time. Samples of ransomware files Ghost used during attacks are:  Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Ghost ransomware incidents. In multiple instances, they have been observed proceeding from initial compromise to the  deployment of ransomware within the same day. Impact and Encryption  Ghost actors use Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe, which are all ransomware  executables that share similar functionality. The nature of executables’ operability is based on command line  arguments used when executing the ransomware file. These ransomware payloads clear Windows Event Logs [T1070.001], disable the Volume Shadow Copy  Service, and delete shadow copies to inhibit system recovery attempts [T1490]. Data encrypted with Ghost  ransomware variants cannot be recovered without the decryption key. The impact of Ghost ransomware activity varies widely on a victim-to-victim basis. Ingress Tool  Transfer  T1105  Ghost actors use Cobalt Strike Beacon malware to deliver ransomware  payloads to victim servers. Table 13: Impact  Technique Title   ID  Use  Data Encrypted for  Impact  T1486  Ghost actors use ransomware variants Cring.exe, Ghost.exe,  ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe to encrypt victim files for ransom. Mitigations  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations reference their #StopRansomware Guide and  implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Ghost ransomware  activity. Ghost ransomware victims whose backups were unaffected by the  ransomware attack were often able to restore operations without needing to contact Ghost actors  or pay a ransom. Ransomware activity generates  unusual network traffic across all phases of the attack chain. Organizations that can successfully identify and investigate this activity  are better able to interrupt malicious activity before ransomware is executed [CPG 3.A]. Victims who have identified and responded to this  unusual behavior have successfully prevented Ghost ransomware attacks. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  See Table 4 to Table 13 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. CISA and NIST  based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common  and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK  for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include logs showing communication to and  from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet  information, and/or decryptor files. Execution  Ghost actors have been observed uploading a web shell [T1505.003] to a compromised server and  leveraging Windows Command Prompt [T1059.003] and/or PowerShell [T1059.001] to download and  execute Cobalt Strike Beacon malware [T1105] that is then implanted on victim systems. Command and Control  Ghost actors rely heavily on Cobalt Strike Beacon malware and Cobalt Strike Team Servers for command  and control (C2) operations, which function using hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and hypertext transfer  protocol secure (HTTPS) [T1071.001]. Instead, connections made to a uniform resource identifier (URI) of a C2 server, for the purpose of  downloading and executing Beacon malware, directly reference the C2 server’s IP address.

According to CISA and trusted third-party incident response data, threat actors chained the listed  vulnerabilities to gain initial access, conduct remote code execution (RCE), obtain credentials, and implant  webshells on victim networks. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. In September 2024, Ivanti released two Security Advisories disclosing exploitation of CVE-2024-8190 and  CVE-2024-8963.[2][3] In October 2024, Ivanti released another advisory disclosing exploitation of CVE- 2024-9379 and CVE-2024-9380.[1]    CVE-2024-8963 [CWE-22: Path Traversal] is an administrate bypass vulnerability that allows threat  actors to remotely access restricted features within the appliance. When used in conjunction with  CVE-2024-8190 [CWE-78: OS Command Injection], threat actors can remotely authenticate into a  victims’ network and execute arbitrary commands on the appliance [T1219].[2][3]    CVE-2024-9379 [CWE-89: SQL Injection] allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin  privileges to run arbitrary SQL statements.[1]    CVE-2024-9380 [CWE-77: Command Injection] allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin  privileges to obtain RCE.[1]  According to Ivanti’s advisories and industry reporting, these vulnerabilities were exploited as zero days.[4]  Based on evidence of active exploitation, CISA added CVE-2024-8963, CVE-2024-8190, CVE-2024-9379,  and CVE-2024-9380 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. According to CISA and trusted third-party incident response data, threat actors chained the above listed  vulnerabilities to gain initial access, conduct RCE, obtain credentials, and implant webshells on victim  networks. Exploit Chain 1  The threat actors leveraged CVE-2024-8963 in conjunction with remote code execution vulnerabilities,  CVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380. Acting as a nobody user [T1564.002], the threat actors first sent a  GET request to datetime.php to acquire session and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens using GET  /client/index.php%3F.php/gsb/datetime[.]php [T1071.001]. In some cases, the threat actors exfiltrated the encrypted admin credentials then decrypted them offline  [TA0010]. In another compromise, the threat actors maintained their presence on the victim’s system for a longer  amount of time. The threat actors used sudo commands to disable the vulnerability in DateTimeTab.php,  modify and remove webshells, and remove evidence of exploitation [T1548.003]. Lateral Movement  In one case, there was evidence of lateral movement after the threat actors gained access and established  a foothold through this exploit chain. It is suspected that the threat actors gained access into a Jenkins  server running a vulnerable, outdated version [T1068]. The threat actors then  attempted to log into the Virtual Private Network (VPN) server but were unsuccessful. After the threat actors gained initial access, they attempted to exploit CVE-2024-9379 to create a webshell  to gain persistent access. Regardless, the application processed both commands, allowing the threat actors to insert a  user into the user_info table. After inserting valid bash code as a user in the user_info table, the threat actors attempted to login as  the user. The authoring agencies believe the threat actors knew this login would fail but were attempting to  coerce the application into handling the bash code improperly. The threat actors repeated the process of echo commands until they built a valid web shell [T1059]. However, there were no observations that the threat actors were successful. Victim Organization 2  This organization had an endpoint protection platform (EPP) installed on their system that alerted when the  threat actors executed base64 encoded script to create webshells. This threat activity included the download and deployment of Obelisk and GoGo Scanner, which  generated a large number of logs. Indicators of Compromise  See Table 1 through Table 3 for IOCs related to the threat actors’ exploitation of CVE-2024-8963, CVE- 2024-8190, CVE-2024-9379, and CVE-2024-9380 in Ivanti CSA. Activity should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support they  are used at the direction of, or controlled by, threat actors.

Deobfuscate/Decode  Files or Information  T1140  Threat actors decrypted credentials prior to exfiltration by leveraging  native tools located in the extracted backup file. Abuse Elevation  Control Mechanism:  Sudo and Sudo  Caching  T1548.003  Threat actors used sudo commands to disable vulnerabilities, modify  and remove webshells, and remove evidence of exploitation. Table 10: Credential Access  Technique Title   ID  Use  Unsecured  Credentials:  Credentials in Files  T1552.001  Threat actors harvested encrypted admin credentials to gain further  access.

Table 13: Exfiltration  Technique Title   ID  Use  Exfiltration  TA0010  Threat actors exfiltrated encrypted admin credentials or other  encrypted data for future use. For Ivanti hosts with Active Directory (AD) access, threat actors can trivially export active domain  administrator credentials during initial compromise. Note: Removing malicious administrator accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering threat  actors may have established additional persistence mechanisms. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats.

Product Security Bad Practices,2025-01-17,1,"{'phishing': 4, 'threats_of_violence': 3}","  Added that software manufacturers should  support phishing-resistant MFA.   Providing time-limited setup passwords that disable themselves when a setup process is  complete and require configuration of a secure password (or more secure authentication  approaches, such as phishing-resistant MFA). Note: Other phishing-resistant forms of authentication, such as passkeys, meet this definition even if  they are the sole form of authentication. Recommended action: For all products besides excepted OT products listed above, software  manufacturers should either support MFA, including phishing-resistant MFA, natively in the product  (if the product itself handles authentication) or support the use of an external identity provider in the  baseline version of the product, such as via standards-based single sign on. Items present in  this list were chosen based on the threat landscape as representing the most dangerous and  pressing bad practices that software manufacturers should avoid. For OT products where MFA use may introduce safety risks (e.g., on medical devices in emergency  rooms where delay in physician access could lead to patient harm), manufacturers should employ  authentication measures that effectively mitigate the threat of single-factor credential abuse and  other authentication threats. Manufacturers should publish a threat model detailing this approach."
Secure by Demand: Priority Considerations for Operational Technology Owners and Operators when Selecting Digital Products,2025-01-13,1,"{'phishing': 4, 'threats_of_violence': 40}","Strong Authentication: The baseline version of the product, especially safety-critical equipment,  protects against unauthorized access through appropriate control measures, including role-based  access control and phishing-resistant multifactor authentication. Phishing-resistant MFA  Buyers should seek products with RBAC and ABAC rather than relying on common accounts. Buyers should look for products with phishing-resistant MFA included in the baseline version. Phishing-resistant MFA is a key security control for  limiting the damage a threat actor can do in an OT environment. Cyber threat  actors can easily exploit these weaknesses across multiple victims to gain access to control systems. Threat Modeling: The product has a full and detailed threat model. Seek out products that have an  up-to-date threat model that articulates the ways in which it might be compromised, along with  security measures implemented to reduce these threat scenarios. By rigorously enforcing purchasing decisions that require and prioritize the purchase of products that  enforce these elements, critical infrastructure organizations can help mitigate current and emerging cyber  threats to critical infrastructure and create a path away from legacy environments. Achieving the right balance is more important than ever as threat actors  increasingly target OT products. Threat actors are successfully targeting particular OT products, rather than specific organizations, because  vulnerabilities span multiple victims and critical infrastructure sectors, and OT products can be access  points to control systems. Threat actors can easily exploit common weaknesses in OT products, such as  weak authentication and authorization, known software vulnerabilities, and limited logging. It is difficult  and costly for asset owners to defend themselves against these threats if security is not considered and  implemented in the design and development of their OT products. The priority elements were selected to mitigate current cyber threats to OT and adhere to common legal  requirements to encourage business practices that empower asset owners to recover the infrastructure  they are responsible for and develop foundational security elements that are uncommon in OT. By ensuring the deployment of secure products on their networks, critical infrastructure owners and  operators can reduce the potential damage from cyber threats and protect their systems from exploitation. Asset owners and operators need this validation to detect and prevent a threat actor from  establishing persistence on OT devices. Owners and operators must be able to recover from incidents in which a threat actor establishes a foothold  or wipes a component on the OT network. Logging is necessary to detect incidents, provide indicators of compromise, and track threat actor  behavior. Buyers should then seek manufacturers that supplement  minimum log types with information from the manufacturer’s written threat model (see the Threat Model  section). Without logs, cyber threat actors can establish persistence through configuration or logic changes, or  degrade operational efficiency, without leaving a record of the action for the operator or incident  responders. For further guidance on OT logging, see the joint guide Best practices for event logging and  threat detection. Why this matters: OT data rarely changes and is valuable for threat actors trying to understand a system. This data underpins the  engineering of the system and gives a threat actor the information needed to create a targeted effect  beyond denial of service. Secure by Default  Selection criteria: The product is delivered secure out of the box, resilient against the most prevalent  threats and vulnerabilities, without requiring additional configuration from users or administrators. The goal of this consideration is to configure security into OT products such that protection against the  most prevalent threats is included by default at no additional cost to the buyer.   Including default configurations that protect against prevalent threats. Components should assume threat actors are on the network. While these systems work  well in a trusted environment, they are obvious targets for threat actors seeking to rapidly degrade OT  systems. A threat actor can recreate those  conditions or send a command to weaponize safety features against the system. Products must mitigate  the risks from a threat actor compromising a trusted device or intentionally violating a standard to do  harm. Threat Modeling  Selection criteria: The product has a full and detailed threat model. What security measures does the product implement to reduce these threat scenarios? Does the manufacturer have a roadmap to address gaps in their threat model? Why this matters: Threat models are necessary for asset owners to understand the risk from a product and  prioritize their security controls. Threat modeling is a structured process designed to identify and  analyze risks. Transparent threat models and corresponding mitigations allow buyers to understand the  risk from disabling product mitigations and determine if a product is maintaining pace with modern threat  actors. Buyers should seek out threat models that track and incorporate threat sources, such as MITRE EMB3D,  so that threats are aligned with modern threat actor capabilities. Public threat sources allow manufacturers  to communicate threats and mitigations using a shared language, making it simpler for buyers to  understand how a product fits into their overall security model. Buyers should avoid products that rely entirely on a threat  actor never accessing the OT network. Buyers should search for manufacturers that use threat modeling throughout the software development  lifecycle to understand where and how security measures should be prioritized and implemented to protect  their product from malicious actors. Manufacturers that document and update threat models, hardening  guidance and secure lifecycle development, are more likely to build products that will be resilient against  both known and emerging threats. Asset owners and operators should partner with a manufacturer’s threat  modelling capability to prioritize upgrades and patches that impact their OT system. Additionally, threat  models enable manufacturers and buyers to answer the following questions:    What security products (e.g., EDR, network monitoring, firewalls) or security controls and policies  (segmentation, password policies) does the manufacturer assume are protecting the product? Why this matters: Patches are an excellent way to protect against known threats."
